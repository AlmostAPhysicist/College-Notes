## Land Acknowledgement
In recognition of the Lenape people, the original inhabitants of the land on which Rutgers University now stands, we acknowledge the university's complicity in the colonial history that displaced and marginalized Indigenous communities. We honor the Lenape's enduring connection to this land and their resilience in preserving their culture despite centuries of adversity. As beneficiaries of this land, we are committed to using our platform to educate students about Indigenous history, foster respect for their cultures, and advocate for justice and equity.
