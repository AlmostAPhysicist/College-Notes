proPEP
- gives you the ISP - Energy per weight/Impulse Per weight.

openMotor
- gives us actual performance of the formula with parameters that have to be tested out physically.



==Strand Burner==
We can use it to calculate the burn rate and get the coefficients we need!

- Pressure regulator
- $r_a=aP_c^b$
