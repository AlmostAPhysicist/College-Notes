1 thing to Note:

Vector + Vector = Vector
Scalar * Vector = Vector

##### Product of vectors

Scalar (Dot) Product $\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B}= c\,, \text{Where c is a scalar}$
Vector (Cross) Product $\vec{A}\times \vec{B}= \vec{c}\,, \text{Where } \vec{c} \text{ is a vector}$

## Scalar Product

$\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B}= |\vec{A}||\vec{B}|\cos(\theta)$
this is the product of the projection and the main vector.

>How aligned are the two vectors/How well do they sit on top of each other

$\hat{A}$ is the unit vector with the same direction as $\vec{A}$
$\hat{A}= \frac{\vec{A}}{|\vec{A}|}$

## Vector (Cross) Product
You need to operate on 2 vectors that also has it's own magnitude and direction.

You can take a plane and take a vector out of that plane with a certain area between the two vectors making a parallelogram.

The direction pointing out of the plane can be up OR down.

By convention, you take the direction with the right hand rule.

$\vec{A}\times\vec{B} = -\vec{B}\times\vec{A}$

$|\vec{A}\times \vec{B}|= |\vec{A}||\vec{B}|\sin(\theta)$ -> the area of the parallelogram that $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ form.
The cross product is the Area Vector coming out of the plane of A and B vectors whose direction is given by the right hand rule.

$F=ma$
and many other such equation have this beauty of having no assigned coordinate system.

You can bring together different coordinate systems AFTER working with them separately.


### Conclusion
$\vec{A}+\vec{B}=\vec{B}+\vec{A}$
$c(\vec{A}+\vec{B})=c \vec{A} + c \vec{B}$
$(c+d)\vec{A}=c\vec{A}+d\vec{A}$
$\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B}= \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A}=|\vec{A}||\vec{B}|\cos(\theta)$
$\vec{A} \times \vec{B}= -\vec{B} \times \vec{A}$
$|\vec{A} \times \vec{B}|=|\vec{A}||\vec{B}|\sin(\theta)$
