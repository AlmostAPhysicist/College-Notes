Now, crawling towards the Idea of Calculus a bit further, [[Maths/Calc 1/Function|functions]] can be Continuous as well as Discontinuous.

Kind of like saying that our [[Maths/Calc 1/Function#^a5fa57|processing unit]], for some inputs, doesn't know how to act. So it doesn't do anything.

Here's an example:

What's $0$ raised to any power ($0^a$)? Just $0$ eh?
What's any number raised to $0$ ($a^0$)? Just 1 eh?

Now what happens if we combine the two?

$$\text{What is } 0^0\text{?}$$
Is it 1? Is it 0? Is it something between the two?

We don't know. And no one does. It's undefined. So the function $f(x)=x^x$ is undefined at $x=0$.

The function has a "hole" over there. In fact, the function isn't defined for any non-positive real value.

The function is however defined for all the positive real values. So we can say the function is [*Continuous*]([[Maths/Calc 1/Continuity|Continuity]])  $\forall \enspace x \in \mathbb{R^+}$ (for all values of $x$ in the set of positive real values)


You can have these holes
