Now, crawling towards the Idea of Calculus a bit further, [[Maths/Calc 1/Number Wizardry - Relations and Functions|functions]] can be Continuous as well as Discontinuous.

Kind of like saying that our [[Maths/Calc 1/Number Wizardry - Relations and Functions#^a5fa57|wizard]], for some inputs, doesn't know how to act. So it doesn't do anything.

Here's an example:

What's $0$ raised to any power ($0^a$)? Just $0$ eh?
What's any number raised to $0$ ($a^0$)? Just 1 eh?

Now what happens if we combine the two?

$$\text{What is } 0^0\text{?}$$
Is it 1? Is it 0? Is it something between the two?

We don't know. And no one does. It's undefined. So the function $f(x)=x^x$ is undefined at $x=0$.

The function has a "hole" over there. In fact, the function isn't defined for any non-positive real value.

The function is however defined for all the positive real values. So we can say the function is ***Continuous***  $\forall \enspace x \in \mathbb{R^+}$ (for all values of $x$ in the set of positive real values)


You can have these holes in between two continuous regions! Then you have a single point of discontinuity.
$\frac{x}{x}$ for instance is discontinuous at $x=0$ 

$\frac{0}{0}$ holds no meaning on its own. Simply because division by 0 is not defined (more on that later).

Notice how it almost "feels" like the function should have a continuous nature. And that both the $x$'s cancel out. Shouldn't that be the case at $x=0$ too? No!

But you are right. Getting arbitrarily close the $0$ does give you a valid result ($f(x)=1$) as long as $x$ is not equal to $0$.

This, is when you talk about [[Maths/Calc 1/Limits|Limits]]...
