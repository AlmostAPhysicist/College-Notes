I think these questions are a little ambiguous. Help can be of different flavors. A help to a friend may have a different emotion attached to it as compared to help to a stranger, and an even different storm of emotions may arise when helping a foe!

But trying to fit an answer as much as I can, I think a common theme among all the helps is that I feel joyful! It's fun, delightful and rewarding to help people.

I wouldn't really say that the other person should be "THANKFUL" or "Reward me for my deeds" (although I wouldn't mind that). But I may expect cooperation while I help them but depending on the situation, I understand even that can be too much to ask. I think help has to be done without any expectations, although I agree we may have few expectations which if met, we would feel really happy, and that never hurts!



I feel shy! But also happy and grateful!
