ED Analyzer Monte Carlo simulation for z lepton and see the remaining stuff that gets produced

plot n tracks per vertex


distance of closest approach dxy impact parameter]

Produce Monte Carlo
Gev
Nhits
impact parameter 
should have all these handles
turn off additional cuts (but still have the option for any )
2,3,4 tracks per vertex

should see some sort of distinct ring for interactions.


- Ask Bruno how to produce the data using the ED producer.
- All the parameters and modifications we can use
- Z boson sample - Z into leptons (with additional jets in the final states - look for itneractions of these jets with the detector - nice and clean!!)

For the dataset in hand,
plot 
- ntracks
- track momenta 
- radial distance for each vertex (possibly with the uncertainties)
- eta, phi distribution of the tracks 
- track impact parameters 
- (if possible, leptons, muons)
- Plot the beamspot in the global coordinate space 

CMS jobs... parallel processing in data
- make sure not many printouts
