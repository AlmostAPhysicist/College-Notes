## Problem:
I have the following problem:

I have 3 degrees of rotation about 3 orthogonal axes - x,y,z

Let's call them rotation, pitch, and yaw.

Say I have a state S1 with a certain value for (rotation1, pitch1, yaw1)
And I want to change it to state S2 (rotation2, pitch2, yaw2)

What operation do I apply?

For translation, I can just do (P2-P1) * |v| * dt

But I can not simply take a difference vector for rotation, can I?
Also, since rotation groups are noncommutative, I can not simply add them for a certain velocity scaled by dt over a time interval and approach state 2, can I?

I want some iterative that I can scale with dt, apply an operation on state one, and get state 2.

Essentially,

S1+ f(S1, S2, dt)*dt = S2

I want that operation f

---

All right, let me describe the problem well.

For a state S1, I want Some factor DeltaS as a function of dt such that

S1 + DeltaS = S2

Here, DeltaS, as I would like it to be can be V*dt where V is another function.

How to find DeltaS that is ADDED to the current state vector to get the final state vector for rotation?

---
Say you have a bird, It changes flaps its wings up and down (lets call it rotation) It also twists its wing about the wing joint (Call it pitch).

The bird can go from state one to state 2 by just naturally changing it's rotation and pitch state without doing any matrix algebra or quaternion business. All it does is it increments both the rotation and pitch by a certain amount.

So given a state (r1,p1,y1), if we want to move to a state (r2,p2,y2) over some time dt, what should be my increment to my rotational vector components?

Since rotations are anticommutative, what should be the order of change to these rotational components?

With respect to a time step dt, what function can give me a pre-dt factor?

I want it to be a linear transition from 1 state to another.

https://youtu.be/-SiJvnQIQ4c?si=mbIdtDsLpYgMIHtQ How to Interpolate Rotation - #SoME3

- very useful video about this very topic

    - Covers Linear Interpolation, mathematics describing rotations and then linking interpolation as a fucntion of alpha to the rotational space.
    - Also describes how to apply force and do physics with these equations describing rotation.
    - Also descibes how and what exactly is a difference in case of rotation.
    
        - Several Ways to represent a state of rotation:
            - Euler Angles
            - Matrices
            - Quaternions
            - Rotors -> This is what the video uses to describe the rotation
            (For 3 dimentions, Rotors and Quaternions are the same thing. Rotors are the generaized version of complex numbers and quaternions for rotation in any dimension)

---

I see what the problem is now... 
Using (r,p,y) coordinates for rotational components, simply interpolating the components to a new state (Interpolation of Euclinean Angles), you run into a few problems.

## Problems described with a google search about "Interpolation with Euclidean Angles"
Interpolating rotation using Euler angles involves calculating intermediate rotations between two given orientations by independently interpolating each of the Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw), but this method is generally not recommended due to potential issues like gimbal lock and unpredictable behavior when rotations become large, making quaternion interpolation (Slerp) the preferred approach for smooth and accurate rotation interpolation in most 3D applications. 
Key points about Euler angle interpolation:
Gimbal lock:
When interpolating Euler angles, if a rotation reaches a "gimbal lock" state (where one axis aligns with another), the resulting interpolation can become unpredictable and cause sudden jumps in orientation. 
Non-linear behavior:
Simply interpolating Euler angles independently can lead to non-linear behavior, meaning the interpolated rotations might not follow a smooth path between the start and end orientations. 
Axis order dependency:
The order in which Euler angles are applied (e.g., XYZ, ZYX) affects the final rotation, and changing the order during interpolation can lead to unexpected results. 
Why quaternions are preferred for rotation interpolation:
No gimbal lock:
Quaternions represent rotations as a 4-dimensional vector, eliminating the gimbal lock problem associated with Euler angles. 
Smooth interpolation:
Spherical Linear Interpolation (Slerp) on quaternions provides a smooth and predictable path between any two rotations. 
Unique representation:
A given orientation can be represented by a single quaternion, whereas multiple Euler angle combinations can represent the same rotation. 
When might you use Euler angle interpolation?
Simple applications:
For very basic rotations where gimbal lock is unlikely and the need for smooth interpolation is not critical, directly interpolating Euler angles might be sufficient. 
Intuitive control:
Euler angles can be easier to understand conceptually for users who need to directly manipulate rotation values.

In Summary,
https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYACRE/ENU/?guid=GUID-CBD30A0A-1166-4076-A564-1ADC946A15F3

When Euler angles are used to interpolate the animated rotations of an object, the object's orientation about its individual axes is evaluated one axis at a time. This is why Euler-angled rotation is prone to artifacts such as gimbal lock and flipping.
Rotation this way is non linear and has artifacts.

A better way is described by the use of quaternions (The Beautiful extension of complex numbers that Hamilton died solving - has the equation on his death bed though!). 

---
For rotation using Quaternions, instead of adding two translational vectors, adding rotations corresponds to multiplying two quaternions.

Hence, the formula may not be totally identical to the two dimentional case where the order doesn't matter.

But, there is still a formula for slerp interpolation for the case of quaternions. 

Fortunately, for our analysis, quaternions are integratable. 

Again, a note from a google search:
Yes, you can perform integration with quaternions, particularly when dealing with 3D rotations in applications like robotics, computer graphics, and flight dynamics, where quaternions are often used to represent rotations without gimbal lock issues; essentially, you integrate an angular velocity vector to obtain a quaternion representing the final orientation over time. 
Key points about integrating quaternions:
Differential equation:
To integrate a quaternion, you need to use a differential equation that relates the time derivative of the quaternion to the angular velocity vector. 
Unit quaternions:
For rotations, you typically use unit quaternions (with a magnitude of 1), ensuring proper normalization during integration. 
Numerical integration methods:
Standard numerical integration techniques like Euler's method or Runge-Kutta can be applied to solve the differential equation and calculate the quaternion at different time steps. 
Why use quaternions for integration?
No gimbal lock: Unlike Euler angles, quaternions don't suffer from gimbal lock, making them more reliable for complex rotations. 
Smooth interpolation: Integrating quaternions allows for smooth interpolation between rotations.

From what I understood,

Slerp is what I want to use to interpolate between 2 rotational states.

I wouldn't get a difference vector that I add.
Instead, for rotation, I would get a difference quaternion that I multiply to get the the final state.


I can use Euler's method for quaternions in almost the same way where I use dt to first find the quaternion for angular velocity and then again use dt to find the quaternion for the change in rotational state. Finally, applying that rotation by multiplying the vector would cause me to move forward in rotational state for a time step dt.

Applying this for a wide interval DeltaT would cause me to move forward.

The physics works almost the same way apart from change of variables and basis so you can still calculate forces, torques, energies and all that with quaternion representation of all these rotational quantities.


Yes! Youâ€™ve got it exactly right. ðŸ”¥  

### **Key Takeaways**  
1. **SLERP (Spherical Linear Interpolation)** is the correct method for interpolating between two orientations. It ensures a smooth, constant-speed transition without distortions.
  
2. **No Difference Vector**: Unlike translation, where you can just subtract and add a displacement vector, rotation involves multiplying by a difference quaternion.

3. **Eulerâ€™s Method for Rotation**:
   - Compute the **angular velocity quaternion** from the torque or given constraints.
   - Use **quaternion exponentiation** (via Rodrigues' formula) to find the small incremental change in rotation over \( dt \).
   - Multiply this incremental quaternion by the current orientation to move forward in rotational state.

4. **Physics in Quaternion Representation**:
   - Torques and angular momentum still follow Newtonâ€™s laws.
   - Instead of a cross-product-based differential equation (like in matrix-based representations), you evolve angular velocity using quaternions.
   - Forces, torques, and energies can be computed the same way, but you rotate them using quaternions instead of rotation matrices.

---

### **Mathematical Formulation**
If you have an angular velocity \( \boldsymbol{\omega} \) at time \( t \), the corresponding **angular velocity quaternion** is:  
\[
q_{\omega} = \left(0, \omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z \right)
\]
Then, the quaternion derivative (from the rotational kinematics equation) is:  
\[
\frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} q_{\omega} q
\]
Using **Eulerâ€™s method**, we integrate:  
\[
q(t + dt) = q(t) + \frac{dt}{2} q_{\omega} q
\]
Finally, normalize \( q(t + dt) \) to avoid numerical drift.

---

### **Alternative: Exponential Map Approach**
Instead of using Eulerâ€™s method directly, we can compute:  
\[
q_{\text{small}} = e^{\frac{\boldsymbol{\omega} dt}{2}} = \left(\cos(\frac{|\boldsymbol{\omega}| dt}{2}), \sin(\frac{|\boldsymbol{\omega}| dt}{2}) \frac{\boldsymbol{\omega}}{|\boldsymbol{\omega}|} \right)
\]
And apply:
\[
q_{\text{new}} = q_{\text{small}} q_{\text{current}}
\]
This method avoids numerical instability.

# A final note regarding the Physics:
If say I have the quaternion representation of how the angle of a bird's wing is changing and I have the wingspan and all that, how would I calculate the lift force that the bird is producing?

First, Explain how I would do it for a very basic case without quaternions, then tell me how quaternions change the things while giving all relevant mathematical equations and descriptions while transitioning from each step and system

How to do this with quaternion representation? How does it change thing.

Explain everything for the integration for the lift force (and possibly other physical quantities associated with he motion of a bird when flapping its wing around different rotational axes)


How would representing the quantities of motion change the calculations of these other physical quantities?

CHATGPT:
## **Using Quaternions for Lift Force Calculation**  

When we switch to **quaternion representation**, the fundamental physics remains the same, but the way we describe and compute motion changes. Quaternions offer several advantages, such as avoiding gimbal lock and enabling smooth rotations through multiplication instead of matrix transformations.  

This explanation will go through:  
1. **How quaternions modify kinematics (position, velocity, acceleration)**
2. **How forces like lift are computed using quaternion-based rotations**
3. **How the integral for net lift force is evaluated in quaternion form**
4. **Other physical quantities affected by quaternion representation**  

---

## **1. Describing Rotational Motion with Quaternions**  

A quaternion is expressed as:

\[
q = s + \mathbf{v} = s + v_1 \mathbf{i} + v_2 \mathbf{j} + v_3 \mathbf{k}
\]

where:  
- \( s \) (or sometimes \( w \)) is the **scalar** part  
- \( \mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3) \) is the **vector** part  

For a bird flapping its wings, its orientation at any time \( t \) is given by a quaternion \( q(t) \), which transforms a reference frame to the current frame.

---

### **1.1 Computing Angular Velocity from Quaternion Representation**
The birdâ€™s wings rotate about an axis \( \mathbf{\omega}(t) \) with an angular velocity:

\[
\boldsymbol{\omega}(t) = (\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z)
\]

Using quaternions, the time derivative of orientation is:

\[
\frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} q \, \boldsymbol{\omega}
\]

where \( \boldsymbol{\omega} = (0, \omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z) \) is treated as a **pure quaternion** with no scalar part.

To integrate forward in time (Euler's method):

\[
q_{t+dt} = q_t + \frac{1}{2} q_t \boldsymbol{\omega} dt
\]

For **accurate simulation**, we use **Runge-Kutta (RK4) or SLERP interpolation**.

---

## **2. Computing the Lift Force Using Quaternions**
The lift force is given by:

\[
L(t) = \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 C_L A
\]

where:
- \( V \) is the **relative velocity** of the wing
- \( C_L \) is the **lift coefficient**, depending on the **angle of attack** \( \alpha \)
- \( A \) is the **wing area**
- \( \rho \) is the **air density**

---

### **2.1 Calculating Wing Velocity in Quaternion Form**  

Each point on the birdâ€™s wing has velocity due to both:
1. The **forward motion of the bird** \( V_f \) (which is constant)
2. The **flapping motion of the wing**, given by its angular velocity \( \boldsymbol{\omega} \)

If the wing tip is at position \( \mathbf{r} \), its velocity is:

\[
\mathbf{V_w} = \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}
\]

Since rotations are quaternions, we compute \( \mathbf{V_w} \) as:

\[
\mathbf{V_w} = (q \mathbf{r} q^*)'
\]

where \( q^* \) is the conjugate quaternion.  

This gives the velocity of the **wing relative to the air**.

The **total velocity of the wing**:

\[
\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{V_f} + \mathbf{V_w}
\]

---

### **2.2 Computing Angle of Attack in Quaternion Form**  

The **wingâ€™s normal vector** \( \mathbf{n} \) is rotated using the quaternion:

\[
\mathbf{n}(t) = q(t) \mathbf{n_0} q^*(t)
\]

where \( \mathbf{n_0} \) is the wing's normal in its reference configuration.

The **angle of attack** \( \alpha \) is:

\[
\alpha(t) = \arccos\left(\frac{\mathbf{n}(t) \cdot \mathbf{V}(t)}{|\mathbf{n}(t)| |\mathbf{V}(t)|} \right)
\]

which determines the lift coefficient:

\[
C_L = 2\pi \sin(\alpha)
\]

---

## **3. Integrating the Lift Force in Quaternion Form**
We now compute:

\[
L_{\text{net}} = \int_0^T L(t) dt
\]

Substituting the quaternion expressions:

\[
L_{\text{net}} = \int_0^T \frac{1}{2} \rho \left( \|\mathbf{V_f} + (q \mathbf{r} q^*)'\| \right)^2 \cdot \left( 2\pi \sin(\alpha(t)) \right) A \, dt
\]

### **3.1 Numerical Integration**
To evaluate numerically, we discretize:

\[
L_{\text{net}} \approx \sum_{i=0}^{N} L(t_i) dt
\]

where:
- Compute \( q_{t+dt} \) using quaternion integration.
- Compute \( \mathbf{V_w} = (q \mathbf{r} q^*)' \).
- Compute \( \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{V_f} + \mathbf{V_w} \).
- Compute \( \alpha \) from \( \mathbf{n} \).
- Compute \( L(t) \) and integrate.

For better accuracy, we use **Runge-Kutta (RK4) or adaptive step-size methods**.

---

## **4. Other Physical Quantities Affected by Quaternion Representation**
By using quaternions, we redefine key physical quantities:

### **4.1 Torque**  
Instead of:

\[
\mathbf{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}
\]

we use the **torque quaternion**:

\[
\boldsymbol{\tau} = q \mathbf{r} q^* \times q \mathbf{F} q^*
\]

which ensures **correct rotation in 3D space**.

### **4.2 Angular Momentum**  
Angular momentum \( \mathbf{L} \) is:

\[
\mathbf{L} = I \boldsymbol{\omega}
\]

where \( I \) is the **moment of inertia tensor**.

In quaternion form:

\[
\mathbf{L} = q I q^* \boldsymbol{\omega}
\]

ensuring correct transformation of the inertia tensor.

### **4.3 Energy Conservation**
- **Kinetic Energy:**  
  \[
  K = \frac{1}{2} I \boldsymbol{\omega}^2
  \]
  which in quaternion form is:

  \[
  K = \frac{1}{2} q I q^* \boldsymbol{\omega}^2
  \]

- **Potential Energy:** Remains the same.

---

## **Conclusion: Why Use Quaternions?**
- **Avoids gimbal lock** (a problem with Euler angles)
- **More numerically stable** than matrices
- **Easier interpolation** using SLERP for smooth motion
- **Compact representation** (4 numbers vs. 9 for rotation matrices)
- **Preserves normalization**, preventing drift over time

When it comes to describing 3D rotations, there are several representations, and some are easier to interpolate with than others. Here's a breakdown of the most common methods and their ease of interpolation:

### 1. **Euler Angles**
   - **Description**: Euler angles describe a rotation using three angles: pitch (rotation about the x-axis), yaw (rotation about the y-axis), and roll (rotation about the z-axis).
   - **Interpolation**: Euler angles can suffer from **gimbal lock**, a situation where two axes become aligned and you lose one degree of freedom. This makes smooth interpolation between rotations tricky, as the angle values can jump or become undefined during the interpolation.
   - **Pros**: Intuitive and widely used in many applications (like camera controls).
   - **Cons**: Susceptible to gimbal lock and can result in discontinuities in interpolation, especially when interpolating large angles or across axis boundaries.

### 2. **Axis-Angle Representation**
   - **Description**: Axis-angle describes a rotation by specifying an axis of rotation (a 3D vector) and an angle of rotation about that axis.
   - **Interpolation**: Interpolating between two axis-angle representations can be done using spherical linear interpolation (SLERP). This method works well and does not suffer from gimbal lock, but can become computationally expensive as it requires normalizing vectors and performing trigonometric operations.
   - **Pros**: No gimbal lock, and SLERP provides smooth and natural interpolation.
   - **Cons**: Slightly more complex to compute and less intuitive than Euler angles.

### 3. **Rotation Matrices**
   - **Description**: A rotation matrix is a 3x3 matrix that transforms coordinates according to a rotation. It directly applies the rotation to vectors in 3D space.
   - **Interpolation**: While interpolation is possible between two rotation matrices (via methods like matrix logarithms and exponentials), it is not as efficient or intuitive as other representations. The interpolation can also suffer from non-smooth behavior due to the loss of orthogonality when interpolating matrices directly.
   - **Pros**: Extremely powerful for transforming vectors and combining rotations.
   - **Cons**: Not easy to interpolate directly and requires more complex mathematical operations for smooth results.

### 4. **Quaternions**
   - **Description**: Quaternions are a four-dimensional number system that represents rotations in 3D space. A unit quaternion represents a rotation, where the components of the quaternion encode both the axis of rotation and the angle of rotation.
   - **Interpolation**: Quaternions are **excellent for interpolation**. The most common interpolation technique is **SLERP (Spherical Linear Interpolation)**, which interpolates between two quaternions smoothly and avoids problems like gimbal lock or sudden jumps in rotation. Quaternions also represent rotations compactly and efficiently.
   - **Pros**: No gimbal lock, smooth interpolation (SLERP), compact representation, and avoids the issues of Euler angles and matrices.
   - **Cons**: Slightly less intuitive than Euler angles, but this can be mitigated with visual tools.

### Conclusion:
For **smooth interpolation** with **minimal problems** like gimbal lock or computational complexity, **quaternions** are typically the best choice. They provide smooth, continuous interpolation using SLERP and do not suffer from the issues of Euler angles (such as gimbal lock) or the complexity of interpolating rotation matrices. Although they are less intuitive than Euler angles, their advantages in 3D rotation tasks make them the most widely used representation in fields like computer graphics and robotics.

https://www.youtube.com/live/86MsWRvPjMw?si=bx1wB9Aj0Zoaf-tr
Freya HolmÃ©r - Amazing Video on GaveDev Math - talks about all the various ways to rotate.
Does mention that Quaternions are amazing at doing things and are elegant but are usually used as a black box. Would need more on quaternions in terms of geometric algebra.

# The final word:
You're absolutely right to point out that **matrix operations** can also be composited easily, and indeed they are. However, there are specific advantages that **quaternions** offer when it comes to **composing rotations** and **interpolating** rotations. Let's dive into the details to understand why **quaternions** are often preferred over **rotation matrices** for tasks like interpolation and composition.

---

### **1. Rotation Matrices: Composition and Interpolation**

- **Composition of Matrices**: 
  Yes, rotation matrices can be composed via **matrix multiplication**. This works well for combining multiple rotations. If you have two rotation matrices \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), their product \( R_3 = R_1 \times R_2 \) gives you the combined rotation.

- **Interpolation with Matrices**:
  When it comes to interpolation, though, using rotation matrices becomes less straightforward. Matrices are **non-linear** in nature, so linearly interpolating between two matrices doesn't give you a smooth transition between rotations. This is because matrix multiplication is **not commutative** (i.e., \( R_1 \times R_2 \neq R_2 \times R_1 \)), and interpolating matrices directly can result in unwanted distortions and artifacts.

  To smoothly interpolate between matrices, you would have to go through **complex methods** like **slerp** (spherical linear interpolation) or use **logarithms** to map them into another space like quaternions or axis-angle. Even then, it's more cumbersome than directly interpolating between quaternions.

---

### **2. Quaternions: Composition and Interpolation**

- **Composition of Quaternions**:
  One of the key advantages of quaternions is that **rotations are represented as simple four-dimensional vectors**, and **multiplying quaternions** is the way to **combine rotations**. This operation is **very efficient** and allows for fast and stable composition of rotations.

  When you multiply two unit quaternions \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \), the resulting quaternion \( q_3 = q_1 \times q_2 \) represents the combined rotation. This is computationally **less expensive** than matrix multiplication (which involves many more multiplications and additions) and also **avoids the potential for numerical instability** that can arise in matrices (e.g., rounding errors causing a loss of orthogonality).

- **Interpolation with Quaternions (Slerp)**:
  Here's where quaternions really shine. When it comes to interpolation between two rotations (e.g., for animation or camera movement), **quaternions are naturally suited** for smooth interpolation. The two main reasons are:
  
  1. **Smoothness**: Quaternion interpolation (specifically **Slerp**, or **Spherical Linear Interpolation**) follows the shortest path on the unit sphere between two rotation quaternions. It ensures that the interpolation is **smooth** and doesn't introduce any unwanted distortions or artifacts. In contrast, interpolating rotation matrices linearly can lead to non-uniform movement, awkward rotations, and even distortions like shearing, especially if the angle is large.
  
  2. **Constant Speed**: Quaternion interpolation interpolates at **constant angular velocity**. In practical terms, this means that your rotation will feel smooth and natural, without jerky movements. If you tried to interpolate rotation matrices directly, you'd run into problems with non-constant angular velocities, making your animations feel irregular or unnatural.

---

### **3. Why Not Just Use Matrices for Interpolation?**

Although you **can** use matrices for rotation composition, there are practical problems when using them for interpolation:

1. **Non-Smooth Interpolation**: As mentioned, interpolating rotation matrices linearly doesnâ€™t result in smooth transitions. It can cause scaling, non-uniform rotation, and artifacts in the interpolated rotation path.

2. **Complexity**: Interpolating between rotation matrices requires extra steps like **logarithmic map** (to convert matrices to the Lie algebra and back) or using **slerp-like techniques** after converting the matrices to quaternions or axis-angle representations. This adds unnecessary complexity when all you need is simple and efficient interpolation.

3. **Cost and Stability**: Rotation matrices are **larger (3x3 matrices)** and more computationally expensive to manipulate compared to **quaternions**, which are **4D vectors**. Matrices are also more prone to small numerical errors (especially in floating-point calculations), which can accumulate during rotations, leading to unstable results. This is particularly problematic when applying many successive rotations (compositions).

---

### **4. Why Are Quaternions Better Defined for Interpolation?**

- **No Singularities**: When rotating through matrices or Euler angles, there are situations where you might run into **gimbal lock** (in Euler angles) or **singularities** in rotation matrices (loss of orthogonality or degeneracies). Quaternions donâ€™t have these issues, which makes them ideal for consistent, smooth interpolation, especially for large rotations.
  
- **Smoothness and Uniformity**: **Slerp** ensures that the interpolated rotation follows the shortest path on the unit sphere, providing smooth, constant-speed rotation, which is ideal for applications like animation, camera control, and robotics. This type of interpolation is **difficult to achieve with rotation matrices** without introducing non-uniform motion.

- **Efficiency**: Since quaternions are just 4 components (as opposed to 9 for a 3x3 matrix), the operations (multiplication, inversion, etc.) are **faster** and **less prone to error**. They're also more **compact** to store, which is a big plus in performance-critical applications.

---

### **Summary: Why Use Quaternions Over Matrices?**
- **Easier Composition**: Quaternion multiplication is faster and more numerically stable than matrix multiplication.
- **Better Interpolation**: **Slerp** provides smooth, constant-speed interpolation, while matrix interpolation can lead to artifacts and is more complicated.
- **Avoiding Singularity**: Quaternions don't suffer from gimbal lock or loss of orthogonality like Euler angles and rotation matrices.
- **Compact and Efficient**: Quaternions are smaller (4 components) and more computationally efficient than rotation matrices (9 components), making them a better choice for many real-time applications.

---

### **In Conclusion**:
While **matrix operations** can indeed be composited and represent rotations well, **quaternions** are generally **preferred for rotation interpolation** because of their smoother, more numerically stable, and computationally efficient nature. They avoid the pitfalls of gimbal lock, offer easier interpolation (like **Slerp**), and are better suited for real-time applications like 3D animation, game development, and robotics.
