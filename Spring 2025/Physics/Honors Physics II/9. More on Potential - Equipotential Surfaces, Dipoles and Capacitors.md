As a revision, by integrating the $dW = \vec{F_{ext}} \cdot d\vec{l}$
(By smartly picking $F_{ext}=-F_{electric}$)
$W = - \int \vec{F_{electric}} \cdot d\vec{l}$
$$W = U = \frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{r_{1\to2}^{2}}$$
(the negative sign vanishes because $d\vec{l} = -d\vec{r}$)

Note, this work is a path dependent work to bring a pair of charges from a distance $\infty$ to $r$

The Work done per unit charge for bringing it at a distance $r$ in presence of a change $Q$ would thus be $$V(Q,r) =\frac{W}{q_{test}} = \frac{kQ}{r^{2}}$$

This work done is stored and hence is equal to the electrostatic potential energy within the system of the pair of charges.

The total work done $(W)$ (and hence the electrostatic potential energy ($U$)) as well as the Electrostatic Potential $(V)$ for a collection of charges, by the superposition principle would be the sum of the quantities for each pair of charges.

As opposed to the Forces, the $W$ and $U$ are added as scalars (since they are scalars unlike the force vectors!).

Finally, $$W = U = \int \vec{F_{ext}} \cdot d\vec{l} = - \int \vec{F_{electric}} \cdot d\vec{l} = - \int Q \vec{E_{electric \, 1 \to 2}} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
$$V = \frac{U}{Q} = \frac{1}{Q}*(- \int Q \vec{E_{electric \, 1 \to 2}} \cdot d\vec{l}) = - \int \vec{E_{electric \, 1 \to 2}} \cdot d\vec{l}$$

It just so happens that actually, the bounds of this integral for our definition are arbitrary. For a general consensus, $$\Delta V = V(\vec{r}) - V(\infty)= - \int^{\vec{r}}_{\infty} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
By convention (and purely by choice that can be changed), Just so $V$ is defined for a point instead of just $\Delta V$ (Even though the entire point of Potential is that it can only be a difference) is that $V(\infty) = 0$

Hence, $$V(\vec{r}) = - \int^{\vec{r}}_{\infty} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
Note, again, this is actually not just $V(\vec{r})$. The integral only defined a difference between the Potential. But for our definition, the Potential at infinity is defined to be $0$. Only then can we talk about potential at a point.

For a point charge, this happens to be $V(\vec{r}) = \frac{kQ}{r}$ (which is a scalar).

Scaling this potential by any test charge $q$ would give us the Electric Potential Energy $$U(Q,q,r) = q V(Q,\vec{r}) = \frac{kQq}{r}$$
(Which, again, as we defined was actually a difference between energy but since we assume zero energy at infinity, we can define energy at a particular point)

This is the $V-r$ (Potential-distance) graph for a positive charge $Q$.

The $V(\vec{r}, Q) = \sum_{i} \frac{kQ_{i}}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r_{i}}|}$
For a collection $Q$ of charges.

So like the sum of forces caused by a collection of charges, by the superposition principle, you can add the potential caused by different charges at a point for the net Potential (as compared to that at infinity) at the point.

The idea is, this Potential is a **Scalar** hence must be added as a scalar, while vectors like Forces must be added like vectors.

For these 4 identical point charges arranged in a square cause force vectors that cancel (In essence, you can bring a charge at this central location and rest). However, their potentials ($\frac{kq}{r}$) add up to $\frac{4kq}{r}$ meaning you will have to do a lot of work to get the test charge there in the first place before you rest!
THAT is the difference between scalar and vector addition that you must keep in mind for potentials and forces.

## Potential As a function of $\vec{E}$ (Electric Field)
$V_{b}-V_{a} = - \int_{a}^{b} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$
$dV = V(\vec{r} + d\vec{r}) - V(\vec{r}) = \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{r}$
$V(x+dx, y+dy, z+dz) - V(\vec{r}) = V(x,y,z) = \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{r}$
$\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial V}{\partial y}dy + \frac{\partial V}{\partial z}dz = -E_{x}dx - E_{y}dy - E_{z}dz$ 

($dV = dV * \frac{dx}{dx} = \frac{dV}{dx} * dx$ which simply means for a function, you can closely approximate the change in y value as a movement along a tangent line. 
This for multiple dimensions, turns into the sum of partial derivatives for each variable of the dimension)

$$\vec{E}(x,y,z) = - (\hat{x} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \hat{y} \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \hat{z} \frac{\partial}{\partial z}) V(x,y,z) = - \vec{\nabla} \, V(\vec{r})$$
(This triple martial differential sum is called the differential operator)

Potential due to a dipole at a location $V(r, \theta) = kqlcos\frac{\theta}{r^{2}}$

One device used to store charge (and hence have some potential) is called a capacitor.
They can be of different sizes. A nice capacitor is 2 plates sitting in parallel ()
