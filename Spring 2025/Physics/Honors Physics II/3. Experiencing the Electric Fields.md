## Recap 
Thus far, the idea we have discussed is that a source charge distribution causes an electric field, essentially a value assigned to each point in space which can then tell us the force per unit charged experienced by any test charge at a particular point.

Mathematically,
$\vec{F} = q \vec{E}(\vec{r})$
and $\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{kq}{r^{2}}\hat{r}$

By the superposition principle, this is independent for each pair of source charge and point in space. Hence, the “net” field at a particular point is simply the vectorial sum of all fields due to all source charges.

More rigorously, 
$\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \sum_{i} Q_{i}\frac{\vec{r} - \vec{R_{i}}}{|\vec{r}-\vec{R_{i}}|^{3}}$
where $\vec{r}$ is a position vector for a point in space and $\vec{R_{i}}$ are the position vectors for source charges.

Note, at double the distance, the length of the vectors would be $\frac{1}{4}th$ since the field vectors are proportional to $\frac{1}{r^{2}}$

- Positive Charges cause fields pointing outwards
- Negative Charges cause fields pointing inwards

If there are 2 distinct charges present, we can have fields caused by both of them and the net vector assigned to each point is the net field vector assigned to the point by summing the individual vectors attributed to that point.

Taking inspiration from the idea of light rays, which really gets to the core of Gauss's law, you can also use **Electric Field Lines** instead of field vectors.

- Field lines start at a positive charge/infinity
- Field lines end at a negative charge/infinity

- The tangent (along with the arrow on a field line) represents the direction of electric field at a particular point.
- The density of field lines corresponds to the strength of electric fields.

Field lines do not cross each other. They represent the net electric field effects.

You can argue geometrically that field lines for a point charge decrease in density with $\frac{1}{r^{2}}$ since each going radially outward will end up on eccentric spheres. Since the surface area of spheres goes up by $\frac{1}{r^{2}}$ but the number of field lines themselves stay the same, the density of field lines decreases by $\frac{1}{r^{2}}$. 

>This idea of field lines across a surface would be crucial for Gauss's law.

## Dipoles 
![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-01-28-12-59-44]]
This configuration of equal but opposite charges separated by a distance is called a dipole.

These separations can be permanent or temporary/induces.

An external electric field for instance would sort of stretch electrons towards one side of an atom, creating a dipole within an atom (actually it will stretch the probability cloud.)

NOTE: how electrons are pulled in the opposite direction as the direction of the field line (towards the source of the field - positive charge) and the opposite is the case for positive charges around a field line.

The field lines for a dipole look like this!

Note how every field line originating from the positive charge drops into the negative charge, even if it travels to an infinite distance, it will return back into the negative charge (even though it may appear it is straight).
>There is an interesting question regarding the field line coming exactly collinear for the two charges, away from the particle pair.

In presence of an external electric field, the dipole rotates into a stable position, aligning with the field.

$\vec{\tau_{1}} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}$
$= \frac{\vec{d}}{2} \times \vec{F}$
$= \frac{\vec{d}}{2} \times (q\vec{E})$

$\vec{\tau_{2}} = \frac{\vec{-d}}{2} \times (-q\vec{E})$

Thus, $\vec{\tau_{net}} = q\vec{d} \times \vec{E}$
This quantity, $q \vec{d}$ is called the **dipole moment**.

Since $E = \frac{kq}{r^{2}}$, by comparison,
$dE = \frac{kdq}{r^{2}}$
$dE_{y} = \frac{kdq}{R^{2}+z^{2}}cos(\theta)$
$\int dE_{y} = \int \frac{kdq}{R^{2}+z^{2}}cos(\theta)$
$= \frac{kQz}{(R^{2}+z^{2})^{\frac{3}{2}}}$

So the takeaway is that you can just treat a collection of charges as literally, a collection of discrete charges. Integrating over the field vectors contributed by all charges, we can find the contribution by the whole cluster.

While solving the integral, we can often take advantage of symmetrical arguments - it be the azimuthal symmetry or the rotational symmetry.
