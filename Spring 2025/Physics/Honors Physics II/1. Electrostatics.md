Of course… It is about Electricity and Magnetism.
In this course, we will try to understand how these two concepts are two sides of the same coin, while extruding the idea to optics and light.

A glimpse of the treasure trove:

$$\oint \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{s} = \frac{Q_{in}}{\epsilon_{0}} \qquad \text{Gauss's Law for Electricity}$$ $$\oint \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s} = 0 \qquad \text{Gauss's Law for Magnetism}$$
$$\oint \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{l} = - \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \oint \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{s} \qquad \text{Faraday's Law}$$
$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_{0} (I + \epsilon_{0} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\oint \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{s}) \qquad \text{Ampere Maxwell Law}$$

## Electric Charge 
Often denoted by $q$, charge is an intrinsic property of matter, just like mass. And like mass governs the gravitational force between matter, electric charges govern electrostatic forces between matter.

A few properties:
- Additivity 
	- Net charge of an object is sum of charges in its constituent parts
- Conserved
	- Each 
- Quantized

A few standards:
- SI Unit: Coulomb
- $m_{e} = 9.1 * 10^{-31}kg$
- $m_{p} = 1837 m_{e}$
- $q_{e} = -1.6 * 10^{-19}C$
- $q_{p} = -q_{e}$

Why would we think it exists?

For gravitational force, we know masses always attract. But conducting few experiments by rubbing stuff and bringing them closer, you can see that few pairs of objects possess a strong attractive as well as repelling force.

Thus, there must be some other force. And that force, as we name it, is the Electrostatic/Electromagnetic (as later named) force.

The spread of charges across different parts of objects can be easy or hard. Thus, objects can be conductors or insulators in terms of how easily they conduct charges.

A fun experiment taking advantage of this conductivity:
![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-01-21-01-00-09]]

So there is a temporary charge produced on end of the metal rod due to induction (and since charge is conserved, other end has the opposite charge now) since electrons can easily move around. Hence, even though net charge on the rod is zero, the induced charge in a metal body can actually make it get attracted to a charged object.

You can also thus make a gold leaf with two petals repel, even when you bring charged objects nearby and not just when to add charge to the leaf.

To some extent, this happens in insulators locally too! To given that you can produce a large torque, even the low force on inductors (due to the local distortion of electron clouds) is enough to rotate it by induction!

Note, at all times, the protons, more or less don't move. It is the electrons that move around. Their shift in position causes and excess or deficit at a certain region (either globally or locally) which causes a certain charge for a particular region.

Why no negative mass? Well... the idea of mass itself is loosely defined. As we would see, Gravity itself, isn't truly a force, as per the formulation by General Relativity.

## More about Coulomb's Law (The Mathematical Expression defining the Electrostatic Force):
$$\vec{F} = K \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}} \hat{r}$$
- $K$ is the Coulomb's constant (sort of like $G$ for gravity) - related to the definition of the unit of charge
$Q = [Coulomb]$
$F = [Newton]$
$K = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}=9*10^{9)} Nm^{2}/C^2$
	$\epsilon_{0}$ is the Permittivity of vaccum
