## Flux and Intuition

The Mono-pole configuration 

You can see that for any fields originating from a charge, for all 3 surfaces, as long as the charge is completely enclosed within the surface, all the fields must pass through the surface. That notion how how many fields pass through the surface is called **Flux**.

This in fact, is all that Gauss law is about.

For a particular surface, we first define an area vector.
Instead of a scalar, area can also be considered as a vector, the magnitude of the vector being the normal scalar quantity of area that we all know of. The direction, by convention, and quite usefully as we will see, is considered to be perpendicular to the surface.

So flux is defined to be $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{A}$
It's a very natural notation to come across whenever you are talking about something flowing across a surface (Even things like flow of water...
![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-01-31-12-57-33]]
Let's say the water flows at $x \, m/s$ then the volume moving across would be $x \cdot A_{\perp} \,m^{3}/s$ (that is what creates a cuboid of the water column)
But you can see how that idea of multiplication with $A_\perp$ is the dot product with the area vector (which by definition is perpendicular to the surface).

For the fact that the mono-pole configuration has a constant flux can be explained as $E$ goes down by $\frac{1}{r^{2}}$ ($\frac{kq}{r^{2}}$)and area increases as $r^{2}$ ($4\pi r^{2}$) so all these cancels.

So essentially, the Flux across a surface is $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{A}$ for a given flat surface. 
For a curved surface however, you again use the calculus trick of breaking the curved surface into infinite flat surfaces and integrate over the $\vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}$ 

Thus, $\phi_{net} = Flux_{net} = \int \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{A}$

(Note, the direction attached to a certain area vector can be arbitrary but once picked the notation, you must stick to it!)

These Surfaces by the way, are called ***Gaussian Surfaces***.

## Gauss Law
***Gauss law*** is about a property of closed Gaussian surfaces, enclosing some charge within.

For a Closed Gaussian Surface,
![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-01-31-01-05-04]]

For this closed surface, the integral has a specific notation (very subtle)
$\displaystyle \phi = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{A}$

(The interesting thing to realize is that if there is no charge present, then every field line entering the surface MUST exit it since there is no source or sink of the field lines (the charge). Hence the net flux must be $0$)

### A simple example
![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-01-31-01-08-25]]

(The above schematic is for a higher quality explanation for why the area is $r^{2}sin(\theta)d\theta d\phi$:
Essentially it is the product of 2 sides - green and red. The red side, considering the larger sphere is $rd\theta$ for a small azimuthal angle theta and the green side, similarly considering a smaller circle in the plan of the green line would be $r'd\phi=rsin(theta)d\phi$ where $r'=rsin(\theta)$ from the original sphere (top left)
Hence, the area $l \cdot b = rd\theta \cdot rsin(\theta) d\phi$)

So for your little element of area, you can use the spherical coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$ and your area element is going to be 
$rd\theta (rsin(\theta) d\phi) = r^{2}sin(\theta)d\theta d\phi$

Both $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{A}$ would have the direction $\hat{r}$.

$\vec{E} = \frac{kq}{r^{2}} \hat{r}$
and $d\vec{A} = r^{2}sin(\theta)d\theta d\phi \hat{r}$

So the flux is going to be $\int \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{kq}{r^{2}} \int_{0}^{4\pi r^{2}} dA$

$\implies \frac{kq}{r^{2}} \cdot 4\pi r^{2} = \frac{q}{\epsilon_{0}}$ (since $k = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}}$)
hence, $$\phi_{net} = Flux_{net} = \oint = \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{int}}{\epsilon_{0}}$$

And that! Is the first equation of the 4 from the set of maxwells' equations.
The beauty is that this holds true not for the monopole configuration and a sphere but any configuration of charge and any surface! No matter the symmetry!
