## Recap 
$$V(\vec{r}) = - \int^{\vec{r}}_{\infty} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
$V(\vec{r})$ is a scalar function that gives out an output with the units $\text{Volts} = \frac{J}{C}$

Another way to look at it is $$\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = - \vec{\nabla} V(\vec{r})$$
(The electric field is the negative differential/gradient of the Potential)

We also learnt that the Electric field lines, because it is just the gradient, would be perpendicular to the equipotential surfaces (Since potential to the field lines there would be no change within the potential energy of an object when moving perpendicular to the Electric field. That is, there would be no work done in moving perpendicular to the electric field.)

## Moving Ahead 
If you use Stoke's theorem $\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = - \vec{\nabla} V(\vec{r})$ here, you can advance Gauss's law $\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{a} = \frac{Q_{in}}{\epsilon_{0}}$ into Poisson's Equation:

$\frac{\partial^{2}V}{\partial x^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2}V}{\partial y^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2}V}{\partial z^{2}} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_{0}}$

(It's the same physics, just different but equivalent mathematical descriptions)
(Further massaging this gives you Laplace's Equation)

## Potential Due to a charge 
For a sphere,
$V(r) = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}$
$\implies V(R) = \text{Potential At Surface} = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}R}$
Hence, A charged object would continue to hold and store charge across a Potential supplied to it.

>The charge stored per unit potential supplied across it is called Capacitance

$$\frac{Q}{V} = 4\pi\epsilon_{0}R = C$$

Note, this is the capacitance for just a spherical object like a shell. But dimensionally, $C=\frac{Q}{V} = k \epsilon_{0}R$ would still hold for a constant $k$.

Moreover, $[C] = \frac{[Q]}{[V]} = [Farad (F)]$

Since voltage is actually not defined but as a difference with respect to another object. Actually you are under the hood considering the capacitance of another sphere at infinity!

So Capacitance too, like Voltage is a relative quantity, but the relation is often with respect to the capacitance of the surrounding. (Essentially, you assume the charge incoming is coming from infinity)

So for a system of 2 objects, $C_{1 \to 2} = \frac{Q}{V_{2}-V_{1}}$

![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-02-21-01-03-42]]

So it is the charge moved across the 2 components of the conductor (hence leaving a $-Q$ charge in one and accumulating $+Q$ charge on the other) when applying a voltage $V_{2} -V_{1} = V$ across them (And hence the Objects themselves have a difference $V_{2}-V_{1}$ potential across their surfaces)

So saying both that the potential applied across is $V_{2}-V_{1}$ and the potential at their surfaces are at a difference $V_{2}-V_{1}$ with a charge transfer of $Q$ from body $1$ to $2$ are equivalent. This charge per unit potential built up/applied is the capacitance.

For a capacitance for 1 parallel plates would be:
![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-02-21-01-09-45]]

$\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = Ea = \frac{Q_\in}{\epsilon_{0}} = \frac{\sigma a}{\epsilon_{0}}$

$\implies EA = \frac{\frac{Q}{a} \cdot a}{\epsilon_{0}}$
$\implies E = \frac{Q}{A\epsilon_{0}}$
$$V = \frac{Qd}{A\epsilon_{0}}$$
(since $E = \frac{V}{d}$)




$\implies Q = \frac{A\epsilon_{0}}{d}V$
$$\implies C = \frac{A\epsilon_{0}}{d}$$
Notice, if $d$ is Zero ($0$) then you would have a single block of conductor. Hence, you would need infinite charge to maintain a potential difference (meaning you can not do it).

## Force to maintain the distance $d$ in a parallel plate Capacitor
Given that the plates have charges $+Q$ and $-Q$ (and hence charge density $+ \sigma$ and $- \sigma$), they must be attracting.

What force which is used to maintain the distance $d$ between the plates, given they have an attractive force?

![](Physics/Honors%20Physics%20II/attachments/Drawing%2025-02-25-12-51-24)

Considering a small patch of area $a$, the Electric field due to Plate 1 on Plate 2 
$E_{1\to2} = \frac{\sigma_{1}}{2\epsilon_{0}}$ (Note that the net field is $\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_{0}}$ but the field due to one on the other is just half)

Then force $F_{1\to2}=q_{2}E_{1\to2} = (\sigma_{2}a) E_{1\to2}$
$\implies F_{1\to2} = (\sigma_{2}a)* \frac{\sigma_{1}}{2\epsilon_{0}}$
But since $\sigma_{1}=\sigma \qquad \sigma_{2}=-\sigma$
$F_{1\to2} = \frac{-\sigma^{2}a}{2\epsilon_{0}}$ for any little patch of area $a$.

But since the field vectors are all parallel, the net force would just be a simple sum of these for all the little areas. $\sum \frac{-\sigma^{2}a_{i}}{2\epsilon_{0}} = \frac{-\sigma^{2}A}{2\epsilon_{0}}$

Hence, $F_{1\to2} = \frac{-\sigma^{2}A}{2\epsilon_{0}}$

To counteract this force to pull the plates apart from a distance $0$ to distance $d$ require a force $$F_{ext} = -F_{1\to2} = \frac{\sigma^{2}A}{2\epsilon_{0}}$$
Hence, the work done (and hence the energy stored in the configuration) is $F_{ext}d = \frac{\sigma^{2}A}{2\epsilon_{0}}d$
(since $F$ is constant throughout all values of distances $d'$)

Multiplying by $\epsilon_{0}$ in numerator and denominator we get:

Hence, $$\text{Potential Energy in Capacitors} = U = \frac{\sigma^{2}A}{2\epsilon_{0}}d = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0} (\frac{\sigma}{epsilon_{0}})^{2}Ad = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0}E^{2}*(Volume_{between})$$
This pre-volume factor is thus an **Energy Density** in an electric field: $\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0}E^{2}$

Massaging this further,

$U=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0}E^{2}(Ad)$
$\implies \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0} (Ed)^{2} \frac{A}{d}$
$\implies \frac{1}{2} \frac{\epsilon_{0}A}{d} (Ed)^{2}$
$$\implies U = \frac{1}{2}CV^{2}$$

## Capacitance for a Concentric Spherical Shell Capacitor 

![](Physics/Honors%20Physics%20II/attachments/Drawing%2025-02-25-01-13-44)

$\phi = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = E(r) * 4\pi r^{2} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_{0}}$

$\implies E(r) = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}$
$-V = V_{b}-V_{a} = - \int_{a}^{b} \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{dr}{r^{2}}$
$\implies -V = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}(\frac{1}{b} - \frac{1}{a})$
$\implies V = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} (\frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{b})$
since $C = \frac{Q}{V}$ $\implies C = \frac{1}{(\frac{V}{Q})}$
$\implies C = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} (\frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{b})}$
$C = 4\pi\epsilon_{0} \frac{ab}{b-a}$
$\implies 4\pi\epsilon_{0}a\frac{a+d}{d}$ {for $b-a = d$}
for $a>>d$
then $\implies C = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_{0}a^{2}}{d}$

Hence $C = \frac{A\epsilon_{0}}{d}$
