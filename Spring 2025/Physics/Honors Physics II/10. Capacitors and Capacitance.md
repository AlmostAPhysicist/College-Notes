## Recap 
$$V_{b} - V_{a} = -\int^{b}_{a} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$$

$V(\vec{r}) - V_{\infty} = -\int^{\vec{r}}_{\infty} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$

And fixing (entirely by choice) $V_{\infty}= 0$, 
$$V(\vec{r}) = -\int^{\vec{r}}_{\infty} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
Which is equivalent to saying (by applying a differential operator in both sides)
$$\vec{\nabla} V(\vec{r}) = - \vec{E}(\vec{r})$$

Which essentially is just taking a derivative on both sides. But since the Potential may be a multivariable function without variable separation, the differential of individual components (refer the recent [[Maths/Multivariable Calc/5. Misclanious#^40883f|5. Misclanious]]) isn't a simple $\frac{dV}{dx}$ but instead, $\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}$. And since we are considering the components, the output is a vector. Not a scalar.

Hence, $$(\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial V}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial V}{\partial z}) = -\vec{E}(\vec{r})$$

## Work and Potential Energy
Note, for a point charge the potential is simply $\frac{kQ}{r}$.
Since work done is just change in kinetic energy, $W_{net} = \Delta KE$, say you have an object moving from 1 orbit to another, if you do work, at the first instance, you would increase it's Kinetic energy. But that gets converted into potential energy. 

It is as if you put in energy on a ball that gets stuck on a tree. Since the ball becomes stationary... did you not input any work?

You did! And that got reflected in the Potential energy!

So actually, for conservative forces, $W_{ext} + W_{cons} = \Delta KE$
$\implies W_{ext} + (-\Delta U) = \Delta KE$
$\implies W_{ext} = \Delta KE + \Delta U = \Delta ME$

So actually, if you really want to know the work done by a certain external agent, you must consider the change in mechanical energy, not just kinetic.

Always note the signs of whether the kinetic energy is decreased, potential energy is increased, etc.

## Equipotential Surfaces 
Since the equipotential surface is the surface at which the gradient Potential does not change, $V(\vec{r}) = -\int^{\vec{r}}_{\infty} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = 0$
You can sort of convince yourself that because of the gradient business and the way wavefronts work, the places where moving across the $\vec{E}$ does no work. 

Hence, you must move perpendicular to the direction in which $\vec{E}$ are pointing for zero work.

Therefore, Equipotential Surfaces are perpendicular to the Electric Field Lines.

## Potential Due to a Dipole 
![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-02-18-12-57-22]]

$V(r, \theta) = \frac{kq}{r_{1}} + \frac{k(-q)}{r_{2}}$
$V(r, \theta) = kq (\frac{1}{r_{1}} - \frac{1}{r_{2}})$

$= k (\frac{1}{r- \frac{l}{2}cos(\theta)})$

You can never have a stable equilibrium since if you do, that means you have an upward climb in all directions. And that would mean the electric field around you has a net inward flux (since you are at the bottom of a hill, and that would mean you have a charge there!


>Earnshaw's theorem

1989 Nobel prize... for non-static fields, you can actually have a sort of stable equilibrium, such that you can trap an ion. So there were ways around Earnshaw's theorem. That was actually the key to the world of Quantum Computing.

At every point in space, you can have a charge distribution with a certain $\rho(\vec{r})$

So $V(\vec{r}) = \sum_{i} \frac{kq_{i}}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r_{i}}|}$
So for a continuous charge distribution with density $\rho(\vec{r})$, 
$V(\vec{r}) = k \int \frac{dq}{|\vec{r_{0}}-\vec{r}|}$
$= k \int \frac{\rho(\vec{r})dV}{|\vec{r_{0}}-\vec{r}|}$
$dV = d^{3}\vec{r}$

## Capacitor 
We saw before that since there is no electric field within a conductor. Hence, the $\int_{a}^{b} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = 0 = \Delta V$ for any two points $a$ and $b$ within the surface.

![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-02-18-01-18-27]]
Since there is no electric field pointing in any direction inside, the Potential along the surface as well as even within the conductor is $\frac{kQ}{R}$

This idea extends to all Conductors.

The Voltage at the surface is always going to be proportional to the surface

(This proportionality is $\frac{1}{C}$)
In other words $C = \frac{Q}{V}$
