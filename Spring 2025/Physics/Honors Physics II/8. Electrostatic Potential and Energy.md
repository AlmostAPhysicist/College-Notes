Drawing a parallel between gravity and electrostatics, we talk discuss the idea of forces more deeply by introducing Energies, Potentials, and all that.

Say you want to know how much energy do you need to spend to bring some charge $q_{2}$ around another charge $q_{1}$...

Say you apply an external force just enough to overcome $F_{1 \to 2}$
The total work you do would be $W = \int \vec{F_{ext}} \cdot d\vec{l}$
To be smart, we picked a force equal to the electrostatic force at each point.
Hence, since the force is equal and opposite, $F_{ext}=-F_{1\to2} = \frac{-kq_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}$
$\implies W = - \int_{\infty}^{\vec{r_{1\to2}}}  \vec{F_{1\to2}} \cdot d\vec{l}$
The bounds, as we bring it from infinity would be infinity to $r_{1 \to 2}$

Hence, $W = -kq_{1}q_{2} \int^{r_{1 \to 2}}_{\infty} \frac{1}{r^{2}} dr$
$$W = \frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{r_{1\to2}}$$
Doing this work, we expend energy. Hence, this energy must be stored in some way within the configuration.
Hence, we say there is a potential energy within the configuration.

Again, as I emphasized in case of gravity, the energy is not associated with any one of the charges. The energy is within the configuration of the SYSTEM of BOTH the PARTICLES.

Note, also, this work done is independent of the path we take. Since. $\implies W = - \int_{\infty}^{\vec{r_{1\to2}}}  \vec{F_{1\to2}} \cdot d\vec{l}$ 
would still hold true and give $W = -kq_{1}q_{2} \int^{r_{1 \to 2}}_{\infty} \frac{1}{r^{2}} dr$
Because if you change your tangential direction, you would not change the magnitude of the force but the dot product would still be $|Force| * |\text{Radial Distance}|$

Because this tangential movement business not changing the dot product, the integral is still the same. Hence, the work done, and hence the potential energy for this conservative force is independent of the path.

This actually also hints what the definition of a conservative force may be. Any force (Not just $\propto \frac{1}{r^{2}}$) that doesn't contribute to the force during tangential movements but only the radial movements would have the same effect where the **Work done is only dependent on the start and end points and not the path**.

Thus, for a closed path, the work done for any charge configuration is $0$ (ZERO).

That is, the closed loop work is always zero for any charge around any other charge. Since the magnitude of the 2nd charge is irrelevant, we can write the integral differently as $\oint q_{test}\vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = 0$
Hence, $$\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}=0$$
This in fact, is a rigorous way to define the fact that Electrostatic force is a conservative force.
This integral $\int_{a}^{b} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$ is actually defined as the (negative) **Potential Difference ($\Delta V$)**

>Negative comes from the fact that it is an integral with respect to $dl$ not $dr$

Which, leads us to the standard definition of a **Potential ($V$) = - $\int_{\infty}^{r} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$**


Given electrostatic conditions, you can represent the Potential as a scalar function of the radius $$V(r) = \frac{kq}{r}$$

Simply put, for any charge $q$, you want the potential at some point at distance $r$ (Which is the Potential Energy per unit charge), it is given by $V(r) = \frac{kq}{r}$
