The idea, as we discussed earlier is that Gauss's Law is always applicable.

$$\phi_{net} = Flux_{net} = \oint = \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{int}}{\epsilon_{0}}$$
Now we're going to use Gauss's Law to calculate electric fields at certain points from objects.

To do this, we consider surfaces, since Gauss's Law requires flux across a surface.
This can or can not be a true, physical surface. We may consider an imaginary surface since the physics would work the same way.

The trick is to consider these **Gaussian Surfaces that have some symmetry** that we can leverage.

For example, finding Electric field from a point at some relative position $\vec{r}$ is as simple as considering a spherical Gaussian surface.

![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-02-04-12-57-30]]

So we can say for a radius $r$, the flux across the surface is $\frac{q}{\epsilon_{0}}$.
$\implies \oint \vec{E}(\vec{r}) d\vec{a} = \frac{q}{\epsilon_{0}}$
Hence $\oint E(r) \, da = \frac{q}{\epsilon_{0}}$ (by the symmetry, the dot product is the same)
$E(r) = \oint da = \frac{q}{\epsilon_{0}}$

Therefore, $$E(r) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}$$
Ahaa!

But we already knew this, this was a trivial backtracking.

Where you see the true powers of Gauss's Law is when you have nice symmetry in a large collection of charges.

![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-02-04-01-02-56]]

Say you have charge $Q$ on a shell. If you want to know the Field inside the shell, you pick a spherical gaussian surface.

$$\phi_{net} = Flux_{net} = \oint = \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{int}}{\epsilon_{0}}$$
Since charge inside is $0$, and $0 = \oint E\, da = E \oint da = E * 4 \pi r^{2}$
Hence, $E=0$

Ahaa! Makes sense! No charge inside implies that in a symmetrical situation, the field is $0$!

**A Very IMPORTANT NOTE! The flux in Gauss's Law is the *NET FLUX DUE TO CHARGES BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GAUSSIAN SURFACE* BUT THE VALUE FLUX ITSELF DEPENDS ONLY ON THE CHARGE INSIDE SINCE ANY FIELD LINE FROM AN OUTSIDE CHARGE THAT ENTERS WILL ALSO HAVE TO LEAVE THE SURFACE!**

### Spherical Symmetry

![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-02-04-01-09-35]]

Here, since charge is inside, $E \oint da = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_{0}}$ since surface has the same symmetry as the charge distribution (and hence the field lines).

So $E = \frac{kQ}{r^{2}}$
(as if Charge is in the very centre, at a single point!)

This is how it looks like for a shell.

There are several different kinds of symmetry - Spherical, Cylindrical, Planar and so on!

>It took Newton Years to calculate this with calculus for individual charges (He had to invent calculus first). Gauss took only the symmetrical arguments of the Geometry of the objects to solve this problem in no time.

Note that the case of Gauss law outside the Charged body with spherical symmetry works not only for Shells but for Spheres themselves! Since the symmetry doesn't change. So it works not just for a charge along a surface but for charge distributed over a sphere with a certain charge density. (The density and distribution doesn't matter as long as the distribution is spherically symmetrical, and we know the net charge inside!)

This is the electric field for a Solid Sphere for different radial distances from center.

### Cylinderical Symmetry 
![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-02-04-01-20-23]]

We use the azimuthal symmetry (The radial symmetry perpendicular to the plan of the flat face of the cylinder.)

---

$\oint \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{a}$
$\oint \vec{E} \, d \vec{a} = E(r) 2\pi r l = \frac{q}{\epsilon_{0}}$

$E = \frac{q}{2\pi r l \, \epsilon_{0}}$
$= \frac{\lambda}{2\pi r \epsilon_{0}}$
($\lambda = \frac{q}{l}$)

![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/IMG_20250204_134539901.jpg]]

### Planar Symmetry 
![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-02-07-12-35-30]]
The field lines come out perpendicularly to the plane with charge density $\sigma$.
By symmetry, there has to be no bias in the direction in which the field is pointing away from the plane (left/right since there are always charges to the left for any charge to the right that cancel any fields in the same plane as the plane itself)

Hence, you see there are perpendicular field lines coming from the surface (Hence the density doesn't change and it hints the field would be constant!).

So let this cylindrical surface be cutting through the surface.

$\oint \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{a} = 2EA = \frac{Q_{in}}{\epsilon_{0}}$
(2 Comes here because $EA$ is the flux across top surface and so is the flux across bottom surface part. So flux through the total closed cylinder surface is $2EA$)

$\implies 2EA = \frac{\sigma A}{\epsilon_{0}}$
$$\implies E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_{0}}$$

---
A consequence of this is that for 2 planes with opposite charge densities you have a region of no field
![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-02-07-12-51-41]]

---
Interestingly, if you look close enough, for a spherical shell, field inside is $\vec{E_{inShell}}=0$
and outside, $\vec{E_{outShell}} = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}R^{2}} = \frac{Q}{A_{surface}\epsilon_{0}} = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_{0}}$

As if the spherical shell is an enclosure of 2 planes that is topside down.
