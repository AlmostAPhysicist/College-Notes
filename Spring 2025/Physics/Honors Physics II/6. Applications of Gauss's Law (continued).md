### Conductors in an external Electric Field
![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-02-07-01-06-02]]

Assuming a free flow of electrons in a conductor, within a conductor, electrons will move whenever there is a net field on them. **And as long as there is a field, they will move!**

This rearrangement, as it happens creates a field that counteracts the external field such that the Net field within a conductor is zero.

A way to look at it, which I really like is **Electrons move in an external electric field *So as to counteract the external field by their own induced field.***
**In a sense that as long as there is a field, the electrons would move. The only way electrons would settle is when the Electric field on them has cancelled out to be zero.**

So considering a settled, electrostatic state, **There is no charge inside the bulk of a conductor.**

By Gauss law, that means that if there were no charge inside a conducting shell, even if there is an external field, the charges on the outer surface of the shell arrange themselves in such a way that the field inside the bulk of the surface (and also the charges inside) happen to be zero. 

Hence, it is as if the conducting shell protects its interior from any field outside.

**Induced Charges on the surface of a conductor, cancel the external electric field that induced those charges in the first place, such that the bulk of the conductor is protected from the outside**

For a shell (or any conducting, closed surface) with no charge inside, that means it is protected from any field outside the shell.

### More on the argument for no charge inside bulk of conductor

Given a conductor, if you agree that for any electric field within it, charges redistribute so as to nullify the electric field (for if there was a field, they would still move).

Why is the redistribution only on the surface?

It's quite elegantâ€¦ if you take a Gaussian surface within the bulk of the conductor (red), since there is no fields within the bulk, we know the flux across the surface is zero.

By Gauss's Law, we know then that there is no net charge within the bulk and interior of the conductor (in case of a shell)!

Therefore, bringing the Gaussian surface arbitrarily close to the surface, we can say that there is no net charge present at any point. Hence, there are no distributions within the bulk. 

Hence, all redistributions must happen only on the surface.

So you would argue for such a condition illustrated above, there would be an infinitesimal polarization for the surface particles.

### Charge Inside a Conductor

So for a charge inside, again, the bulk itself would have no fields. Hence, the charges will have to redistribute on the inner surface, such that there is no charge within our Gaussian surface within the bulk (Hence charge on inner surface will be equal and opposite).

But since charge has to be conserved, the opposite charge would appear on the outside surface. Thus, for any point outside the conductor, there would be still a net charge within it. (Duh, obviously, we put a charge inside). So there still must be an influence of the onside charge on the outside world. BUT the point is that the way the influence happens is property only of the outside surface geometry. No one knows from the influence outside the conductor what is happening inside. So even an ugly, asymmetrical distribution would cause a distribution on the outside surface so as to minimize the cost/potential of the charge distribution.

Only the geometry of the outer surface determines the symmetry of the field but the field is caused by the inside charge, irrespective of the interior symmetry.
