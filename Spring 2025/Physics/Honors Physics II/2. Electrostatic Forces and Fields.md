### Coulomb's Law
![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-01-24-12-30-07]]

$\vec{r} = \vec{r_{2}} - \vec{r_{1}}$
$F_{1 \to 2} = K \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}} \hat{r}$
$=K \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{3}}\vec{r}$
$=K \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{|\vec{r_{2}}-\vec{r_{1}}|^{3}} (\vec{r_{2}}-\vec{r_{1}})$

>Essentially, The coulomb force on one charge due to another is proportional to the charges and inversely proportional to the distance (squared!), in the direction of the direction vector from charge source charge to the test charge.

$1e  = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}C$
$K = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}=9 \times 10^{9}$

### What happens if you have more charges in the system?

![[Physics/Honors Physics II/attachments/Drawing 25-01-24-12-39-44]]

Bringing a third charge $q_{3}$ could have made things complicated. But it turns out that it does nothing to the force between $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$

Forces between the pairs $(q_{1}, q_{2}), (q_{2}, q_{3}), (q_{1}, q_{3})$ exist independently. The net force is simply the sum of all force vectors on a particular charge.

It's that simple!

This is called the **superposition principle**.

So considering the force on a test charge ($Q$) due to a group of charges ($q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, q_{4} \dots$) is simply the vectorial sum of the forces that would be independently caused by them $F_{net} = \vec{F_{1}} + \vec{F_{2}} + \vec{F_{3}} + \vec{F_{4}} \dots$

where $F_{i} = K \frac{q_{i}Q}{r_{i}^{2}} \hat{r_{i}}$

The superposition principle is very powerful! It is the reason light from two flashlights just passes through each other. (Hard to make lightsaber lol)

Light does not really interact so easily.

Static charges are well understood with just this idea. It is when charges move that you introduce interesting behaviors due to production of magnetic fields. This behavior often tends it to lose energy. In fact, this is what made us think of the Quantum world more deeply — why is the atom stable if the electron keeps moving (it is, after all, just a moving charge).

# Fields
The idea of a force can further be massaged and make it more useful when understanding forces on objects is the idea of fields.

Fields are essentially the idea of “What force would there be IF there were to be a charge there?”. It was in fact a computational tool, by saying
$\vec{F} = Q \vec{E}$.

Since we can then get rid of the test charge with this definition since $\vec{E} = K \frac{q}{r^{2}}\hat{r}$
(or the net sum of these in case of net Electric Fields), we can operate on any charge as a function.

---
It turns out this idea of a field is more seamlessly embedded in physical reality than one might think. Charges, as it happens, do produce a field across space and time by merely existing. And with charges, the fields move too.

---
The idea of a field is that given the value of field at any point, you can and you do know everything about a force on a charge placed in any location. So knowing the force comes down to finding the field. 

>Electric field is a force per unit charge.

The electric field is real. Yet not visible directly. The only way you can "see" the electric field is by the force it induces on a test charge.

So the problem of **Adding Force vectors $\vec{F}$** due to source charge for a particular charge each time translates to the problem of **Adding Field Vectors $\vec{E}$** for particular points, and then you can treat ANY charge.

---
It may not be as necessary for static charges. But for moving charges, it becomes the heart for the description for what something as important as Light itself is tied to the field not the force! Light itself is a disturbance in the $\vec{E}$ and this disturbance is what travels at the speed of light!

### Some fun experimentation

**A Van digraph Generator**
Essentially, it is a mechanical version of wool and amber rubbing together. It has a belt rubbing on brushes, connected to a sphere, and so on. I don't think any more details are necessary, and I need to know the particular mechanical structure. With enough rubbing, we have a high amount of charge generated, distributed all around a spherical shell. With all this charge, you produce strong electric fields. If there is a conductor in the vicinity, you can have a breakdown and a spark!
