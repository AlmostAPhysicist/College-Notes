We'll just be doing Calc I again, but with multiple variables.

Like Calc 1, we'll be doing both 
- derivatives 
- integrals

### Derivatives
![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-22-04-08-42]]

As we know, the derivative of a function gives us the slope at a certain point, which helps you get a tangent line (and many more things).

$f(x)=x^{2} \implies f'(x)=2x$ 
would be a classic example for a single variable function.

In this course, we focus on multivariable functions (Hence called Multivariable Calculus). Something like:
$z=f(x,y)$

With an additional variable, you need another axis...
![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-22-04-13-15]]

Let's extend our very basic example to $z=f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}$
> #funfact this is called a paraboloid.

![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-22-04-15-37]]

The idea of a tangent line for 1 variable is what linear function approximates the function at a particular point.
Extending this to 3 dimensions is to think how to approximate a particular n-dimensional curve around a point. 

For multiple variables, you have multiple tangent lines passing across a point, and pushing your brain cells a bit, you could imagine the curve is going to be approximated with a tangent plane/surface.

A line can be written as $ax+by=c$
and a correlation to a plane can be another equation $ax+by+cz=d$ where all variables are linear.

To understand these shapes and curves, for instance a plane, a very useful mathematical object happens to be a vector.

And so here we go…

# Vectors
>vector : a quantity that is specified with two things
- length (magnitude)
- direction in space 
![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-22-04-32-22]]
Examples:
- position/displacement vector
	- ![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-22-04-34-54]]
	- notion: when referring to a vector, draw an arrow above it's name (or in bold letters when typing)

##### Some more terminology
We will refer to numbers as scalars. More generally, a scalar is a quantity that doesn't require a direction. In essence, multiplying a vector only “scales” other objects, doesn't rotate it.

Note:
Angles are also scalars!
Scalars are allowed to be negative or positive (you may think of the sign as the embryonic direction!).

### Operating on Vectors
#### Addition 
(Parallelogram Law)
![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-22-04-51-21]]

Because of the symmetry in the Parallelogram, you can choose to add $\vec{v_{1}}$ to $\vec{v_{2}}$ or $\vec{v_{2}}$ to $\vec{v_{1}}$, it doesn't matter!

You can also look at a single half of it as a triangle.

The sum is the diagonal of the Parallelogram and/or the 3rd side of a triangle. The thing to note, however, is that the vectors are **joint tip to tail**!


>The magic of vector addition is that once established a component-wise representation of vectors as the standard vectors starting from origin, is that adding vectors corresponds to the simple addition of its components, as we are familiar for the case of scalars.

![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-22-05-01-40]]
So you add the first entries together and the second entries together. This works regardless of the number of entries.
>So despite appearances, it need not be drawn on a plane.

So more generally,
$v_{1}= (x_{1},y_{1},z_{1},w_{1}\dots)$
$v_{2}= (x_{2},y_{2},z_{2},w_{2}\dots)$
$\implies v_{1}+v_{2} = (x_{1}+x_{2}, y_{1}+y_{2}, z_{1}+z_{2}, w_{1}+w_{2} \dots)$
