Interestingly, if you think about it, 
![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-27-03-56-24]]

One diagonal of a the Parallelogram for the 2 vectors corresponds to the sum and the other corresponds to the difference!

In fact, often, the difference is quite a useful quantity.

Considering standard vectors for instance (vectors starting at the origin), $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{u}$ can be 2 position vectors. Then, the direction vector from $U$ to $V$ would be $\vec{u} - \vec{v}$ (final minus initial)

![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-27-04-02-33]]

$\vec{VU} = (x_{u}, y_{u}, z_{u}) - (x_{v}, y_{v}, z_{v})$

Quantities like Forces often act along the relative direction vector of objects hence it is quite useful for this.

$|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{v_x^{2}+v_y^{2}+v_z^{2} \dots}$

>Essentially, by a very simple extension of the Pythagorean theorem, in Euclidean space, you define the length of a vector or distance along a direction vector to be the square root of the sum of squares of it's components.

## Multiplication of Vectors
- Dot product
- Cross product

### Dot Product 
Physically (I like to first think of it physically), it is the product of length of a vector and the length of the projection of another vector (when projected on to the first vector).

![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-27-04-25-53]]

$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = vu cos(\theta)$

Interestingly, this gives you a number/scalar!

The dot product has a distributed property ($\vec{u} \cdot (\vec{v_{1}} + \vec{v_{2}}) = \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v_{1}} + \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v_{2}}$)

---
A very nice algebraic property, as one can show quite easily once you play around with it is that you can translate these properties to the fact that

$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = <u_x, u_y, u_z> \cdot <v_x, v_y, v_z> = u_x \cdot v_x + u_y \cdot v_y + u_z \cdot v_z$

---
The use fullness of the dot product is that it can often be handy in finding out how aligned 2 vectors are. If two vectors are perpendicular/orthogonal, then their dot product is zero.

$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = 0 \implies \vec{u} \perp \vec{v}$
and the angle $\theta$ between them is $90 \degree$ or $\frac{\pi}{2}rad$

(quite simply, this is a result of the fact that $uvcos(\theta)=0$ would mean $\theta = 90 \degree$, for $u,v \neq 0$)
In essence, this certifies that they are perpendicular and totally misaligned and do not share anything with each other.

### Basis Vectors/Canonical/Standard Unit vectors
![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-29-03-54-58]]
The unit vectors in $x$, $y$ and $z$ axis are called $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$ and $\hat{k}$.
- unit vector ($length=1 \implies \hat{i} \cdot \hat{i} = \hat{j} \cdot \hat{j} = \hat{k} \cdot \hat{k} = 1$)
- Mutually Orthogonal/Perpendicular 
	- $\hat{i} \cdot \hat{j} = \hat{j} \cdot \hat{k} = \hat{k} \cdot \hat{i} = 0$
- Decomposition property
	- Any vector in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ can be decomposed in terms of $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$ and $\hat{k}$
		- From Linear Algebra, you know that is the case since by definition, the orthonormal basis is set up such that $Span \set{\hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k}}=\mathbb{R}^{3}$
- $\hat{i} = (1,0,0)$, $\hat{j} = (0,1,0)$ and $\hat{k} = (0,0,1)$

Example:
$\vec{v} = (1,2,3) = 1\hat{i} + 2\hat{j} + 3\hat{k}$

---
Using this, we can find an alternative way to represent a dot product.

For instance, the dot product $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u}$ for $\vec{v}=(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3})$ and $\vec{u}=(u_{1},u_{2},u_{3})$
can be written (in addition to $vucos(\theta)$) would be:
$(v_{1}\hat{i} + v_{2}\hat{j} + v_{3}\hat{k}) \cdot (u_{1}\hat{i} + u_{2}\hat{j} + u_{3}\hat{k})$

If you foil this out, you notice that since $\hat{i} \cdot \hat{j} = 0,\hat{i} \cdot \hat{k} = 0, \hat{j} \cdot \hat{k} = 0$, a lot of the terms cancel and finally, we get 
$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + u_3v _3$

---
Combining both notations by the way, gives us a means of finding the angle between two vectors:
$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = uvcos(\theta)$
$\implies cos(\theta) = \frac{\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}}{uv}$
$\implies cos(\theta) = \frac{u_{1}v_{1}+u_{2}v_{2}+u_{3}v_{3}}{uv}$


>You also have a dot product for functions defined: $f(x) \cdot g(x) = \int^{b}_{a} f(x)g(x)\,dx$
>In fact, this idea that functions themselves can be perpendicular, is the heart of Fourier transformations which in sense relies on the fact that $sin(x)$ and $cos(x)$ are perpendicular to each other
