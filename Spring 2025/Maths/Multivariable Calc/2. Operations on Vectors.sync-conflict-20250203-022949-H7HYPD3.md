Interestingly, if you think about it, 
![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-27-03-56-24]]

One diagonal of a the Parallelogram for the 2 vectors corresponds to the sum and the other corresponds to the difference!

In fact, often, the difference is quite a useful quantity.

Considering standard vectors for instance (vectors starting at the origin), $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{u}$ can be 2 position vectors. Then, the direction vector from $U$ to $V$ would be $\vec{u} - \vec{v}$ (final minus initial)

![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-27-04-02-33]]

$\vec{VU} = (x_{u}, y_{u}, z_{u}) - (x_{v}, y_{v}, z_{v})$

Quantities like Forces often act along the relative direction vector of objects hence it is quite useful for this.

$|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{v_x^{2}+v_y^{2}+v_z^{2} \dots}$

>Essentially, by a very simple extension of the Pythagorean theorem, in Euclidean space, you define the length of a vector or distance along a direction vector to be the square root of the sum of squares of it's components.

## Multiplication of Vectors
- Dot product
- Cross product

### Dot Product 
Physically (I like to first think of it physically), it is the product of length of a vector and the length of the projection of another vector (when projected on to the first vector).

![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-01-27-04-25-53]]

$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = vu cos(\theta)$

Interestingly, this gives you a number/scalar!

The dot product has a distributed property ($\vec{u} \cdot (\vec{v_{1}} + \vec{v_{2}}) = \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v_{1}} + \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v_{2}}$)

---
A very nice algebraic property, as one can show quite easily once you play around with it is that you can translate these properties to the fact that

$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = <u_x, u_y, u_z> \cdot <v_x, v_y, v_z> = u_x \cdot v_x + u_y \cdot v_y + u_z \cdot v_z$

---
The use fullness of the dot product is that it can often be handy in finding out how aligned 2 vectors are. If two vectors are perpendicular/orthogonal, then their dot product is zero.

$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = 0 \implies \vec{u} \perp \vec{v}$
and the angle $\theta$ between them is $90 \degree$ or $\frac{\pi}{2}rad$

(quite simply, this is a result of the fact that $uvcos(\theta)=0$ would mean $\theta = 90 \degree$, for $u,v \neq 0$)
In essence, this certifies that they are perpendicular and totally misaligned and do not share anything with each other.

---
Another "sort of" useful case dot products can be handy is to figure out the length of a vector by an already defined function.

Essentially, $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{u} = uucos\theta = u^2$ (since the angle made by a vector with itself is 0 and $cos(0)=1$)

So $|\vec{u}|=\sqrt{\vec{u} \cdot \vec{u}}$

And why would we do that?

Well, $|\vec{v_1} + \vec{v_2}| =\sqrt{(\vec{v_1} + \vec{v_2}) \cdot (\vec{v_1} + \vec{v_2})}$
$= \sqrt{\vec{v_1} \cdot \vec{v_1} + \vec{v_2} \cdot \vec{v_2} + 2\vec{v_1} \cdot \vec{v_2}}$
$= \sqrt{(v_1^2 + v_2^2 + 2v_1v_2cos\theta)}$

(Something I used here is also that $\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}=\vec{v}\cdot\vec{u}$)
