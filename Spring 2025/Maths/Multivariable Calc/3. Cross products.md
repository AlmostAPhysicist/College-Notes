In addition to the dot product, there is another way to multiply 2 vectors, with each other, known as the cross product, denoted as w $\times$ v. 

 >Interestingly, the cross products works best specifically in $2$ or $3$ dimensions
 
 Physically, cross product represents the $n$-dimensional volume of the parallelepiped formed by the vectors.

$\vec{u} \times \vec{v}$ gives is another *Vector*.
Hence, we would have to have a direction as well as a magnitude.

>The cross product is chosen such that it comes out orthogonal to the input vectors.

By define the cross product, by convention, to have a direction given by the right-hand rule.

So you sort of fold your fingers from initial vector $\vec{u}$ towards final vector ($\vec{v}$) (when joined tail to tail!) and your thumb would point in the direction of $\vec{u} \times \vec{v}$.

You can convince yourself just because $\vec{v} \times \vec{u}$ would have to have a different hand gesture is that 
$\vec{u} \times \vec{v} = - \vec{v} \times \vec{u}$

In higher dimensions, you can set the direction to be perpendicular but since you would have more than 1 degree of freedom (more than just 1 scalar), it ruins the idea of a cross product to be a function. However! You can save yourself with an **outer product**.

We've taken care of the direction of the cross product but what about the length/magnitude?

Similar to the dot product, $|\vec{u} \times \vec{v}| = uvsin(\theta)$.

To reiterate, the value of the cross product is defined so that the length of the vector gives the $n$-dimensional area/volume of the Parallelogram made by the vectors.

In fact, the cross product does give the area vector since the area vector is perpendicular to the plane of the sides.

An obvious consequence is $\vec{u} \times \vec{u} = \vec{0}$.

The reason we have $\hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k}$ in a very specific orientation is because by convention, we always want $\hat{i} \times \hat{j} = \hat{k}$

so setting up the $x$ and $y$ axis, there is a very specific orientation that we can set the $z$ axis in.
