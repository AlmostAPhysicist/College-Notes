## Functions of two variables $f(x,y)$
![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-02-19-03-53-40]]
For functions that are only dependent on a single variable the function plot lies in 2 dimensions — 1 for the input, 1 for the output value.

(note you can not convert functions with multiple input variables into a **single variable function**. $x^{2}+y^{2}=2$ does not have any "input" or "output". In fact, it is NOT a function. 
>It is a curve which can be parameterized as a function $r(\theta)$ or $y(x)$ but it remains to be a single variable function.


For **multivariable functions**, as the dimensions of inputs (independent inputs) increases, so would the dimension of the plot. 
Again, 1 dimension would be that of the value of the function but the other dimensions would be of the input values.

>A multivariable function of 2 variables is actually a surface.

As an obvious extension, for an $n$ variable function, you would have a plot with $1$ dimension for the function output value and $n$ dimensions for the input values. Hence, the plot would be $n+1$ dimensional and the function output would be an $n$ dimensional object (such as a hypersurface)

## Domain of a function
The domain of a function is literally the interval of input for which the value of the function is validly defined.

As an example, $y=f(x)=\sqrt{x+1}$
For a real valued domain function, the square root can not contain a negative number. Hence, to find the domain, $x+1 \geq 0 \implies x \geq -1$
Hence, the Domain for the function is $domain=[-1, \infty)$

### Domain of a multivariable function 
- What is the domain of $z=f(x,y)=\sqrt{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$
The domain, firstly would not be different for $x$ and different for $y$. The domain would actually be the set of points in the input space $(x,y)$ for which the function makes sense and gives a valid output.

Again, for a real valued function, $\sqrt{f(x,y)} \geq 0$
Hence $f(x,y) \geq 0$
(Actually it is more like the square root's input by definition can not be negative in a real valued domain function - **to find the domain, you must ask yourself, for what input value is the function defined for?**)

Hence, $4-x^{2}-y^{2} \geq 0$
$\implies 4 \geq x^{2}+y^{2}$
![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-02-19-04-17-31]]
Hence, you can imagine this would be set of points on and inside the circle of radius $2$ in our input space $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ ($x \times y$) 
>This cross by the way is the Cartesian product... essentially the set of all points when pairing every point in $x$ with every other point in $y$. It is essentially the space covered by the plane made by $x$ and $y$ axis combined.

(By the way, this was a trivial case for the regions. The way you actually chose a region is you look at the critical points/curves/hypersurfaces (whatever lower dimensional object you have) that sits at the equality. 

Then, you would have the input space split in different regions, to see which region is within the actual domain, check a point in both or either of the regions. If the point satisfies the condition, that is the region of interest!)

Note: You can **not** decompose this into an interval notation at all times.

For example
$4 \geq x^{2}+y^{2}$ does **NOT** imply $x<2$ and $y<2$ 
![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-02-19-04-26-38]]

Note, in this case you would actually have a square. So *DO NOT SPLIT THE DOMAIN CONSTRAINTS INTO INTERVALS*.

(Actually, for this particular case of $4 \geq x^{2}+y^{2}$ you can have a change of coordinates to polar coordinates and you can in fact split the interval as $r \in [0,2]$ and $\theta \in [0, 2\pi]$ but this is not a very general property for functions)

>You must actually think of domain as a sort of shadow of the function geometry onto the input space.

#### Conditions for a valid domain 
The conditions truthfully are a property of your function of interest and the way it has been defined.

- $f(x,y) = \frac{ln(y-x)}{\sqrt{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}}$

So here, we need 2 conditions to be met.
1. $y-x>0$ since that is the condition for the $ln(y-x)$ part of the function
2. $4-x^{2}-y^{2} \geq 0$ for the denominator of the function to be valid
3. $\sqrt{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \neq 0$ since division by zero is not defined

Hence, overall, our domain is the intersection of the regions $$\cases{y-x>0 \\4-x^{2}-y^{2}>0}$$
![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-02-19-04-37-16]]

So the intersection of the blue and red region (Overall just the green region) is our Domain.

You do not really know what the actual function looks like but a cool fact, as mentioned before is that if you look at the graph exactly vertically, you will really just be looking at the domain since it is a shadow of the function.

## A brief word on Limits 
You remember limits... Duh. It is the value that your function approaches if your input gets arbitrarily close to your actual input of interest.

>a good strategy to show that a limit does not exist is by checking that the one-sided limits are different.

Since you can approach a certain value from different directions (especially in higher dimension input spaces), your Limit can **NOT** exist if the value of the function or any one approach from any one direction is different from any other approach for a function around an input value.

#### Example of a multidimensional limit
- $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^{2}-y^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}$
So all you have to do is check and confirm that the limit can not depend on the path chosen to reach the origin.
(Remember, the limit itself is blind to whether the function itself is defined or not)

Now, how do we chose the path of approach when we have infinite paths?
1. line $y=x$
![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-02-19-04-59-07]]

Since a particular path is a curve, we should be able to define it in just one variable. So for this particular path, $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^{2}-y^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}} = \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^{2}-x^{2}}{x^{2}+x^{2}}$

Now this has just been translated to a limit in 1 variable.

Now, since $x^{2}-x^{2} = 0$ and $x^{2}+x^{2} = 2x^{2}$ $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^{2}-y^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}} = \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{0}{2x^{2}} = 0$
(if anything, now you can use all your tools like L'Hôpital's Rule, etc... just to be sure.)

Now you can check it on another path
1. $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^{2}-y^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ for $y=2x$
Here, $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^{2}-y^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}} = \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^{2}-2x^{2}}{x^{2}+(2x^{2})} \neq 0$

Since at least 2 of the paths do not match, the limit does not exist.

>Note: This method does not guarantee that the limit exists since you would have to check infinite paths for that. Does does provide possible counterexamples given that you pick your curve smartly. Also, the curve need not be linear. All you want is a curve! 

So the core idea here is that for a limit to exist, its value cannot depend on a particular path that you use to compute it. (Called the `path test`)

## Level Curves 
(for a function $f(x,y)$)

(AKA contours)

The graph $z = f(x,y)$ is a surface 
![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-02-24-04-19-59]]

Idea of a level curve:
Find all the points $(x,y)$ where the function takes a particular value

- Example 
$f(x,y)=4-x^{2}-y^{2}$

(Or another way to look at it is $f(x,y) = 4-(x^{2}+y^{2}) \implies z = 4-r$ where $r$ is the radial distance in $x-y$ plane)

![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-02-24-04-28-27]]
(like an upside down bowl)

The level curve for a particular value, say $z=2$ would just be

$f(x,y)=4-x^{2}-y^{2}=2 \implies x^{2}+y^{2}=2$

Which would just be a circle of radius $\sqrt{2}$

![[Maths/Multivariable Calc/attachments/Drawing 25-02-24-04-32-08]]
So in essence, you would map all the 3d points down on the input plane with contour lines at points with the same function value.

A curve for an equipotential surface ![[Physics/Honors Physics II/10. Capacitors and Capacitance#^a21175|10. Capacitors and Capacitance]]
for instance is just a level curve diagram (a contour map) where the input space is the plane in which the dipole charges reside and the function value is the potential at any point in the space.

Obviously, level curves for different values don't intersect (since that would mean 1 point would have 2 distinct values)
