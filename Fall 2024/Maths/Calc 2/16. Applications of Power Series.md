Various instances where power series arise.

## Integrals
- $\int^{1}_{0} e^{-\frac{x^{2}}{2}}\,dx$
You could try, but this has no elementary function you can evaluate this as/with.

BUT! you can however, evaluate this as the integral of $exp(u) = \sum^{\infty}_{0} \frac{u^{n}}{n!}$ fir $u = -\frac{x^{2}}{2}$
and we would get a nice $\sum^{\infty}_{1} \frac{(-1)^{n} x^{2n+1}}{2^{n}n!(2n+1)}$ evaluated from $x=0$ to $x=1$
Which you can estimate by truncating a power series to a finite series since the value converges.

- Another example would be $\int^{2}_{0} \frac{1-cos(x)}{x^{2}}\,dx$
Note, the bounds must be in the interval of convergence for this.

You may think calculators work by approximating functions with Taylor Series but it turns out, for trig functions, they use a CORDIC algorithm which instead approximates a function better than the Taylor series (Taylor series are still best polynomials of approximation but cordic algorithms are just things like look up tables.)

## Evaluating Infinite Series
- $4 \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{2n+1}$
The way we can do this is to recognize this is a power series representation of an evaluable function.

Recall $arctan(x) = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^{n}x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}$ (IOC of $[-1,1]$)
So $4 \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{2n+1} = 4 arctan(1) = 4 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} = \pi$ (essentially, our our series can be the arctan series evaluated at $x=1$)
(we don't use this series to approximate $\pi$ since it converges very slowly)

## Evaluating Limits 
- $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x^{3} - arctan(x^{3})}{x^{9}}$
Lopital can work but power series are in essence, standard results from lopital.
