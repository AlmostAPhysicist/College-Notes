#def A Power Series centered at zero is a series of the form $\sum^{\infty}_{n=k} c_{n}x^{n} = c_{0} + c_{1}x^{1}+c_{2}x^{2} \dots$
where $c_{n}$ is some sequence of number

More generally, a Power Series centered at $b$ is a series of the form $\sum^{\infty}_{n=k} c_{n}(x-b)^{n} = c_{0} + c_{1}(x-b)^{1}+c_{2}(x-b)^{2} \dots$
(Essentially, the center of coordinate $x=0$ shifted to $x=b$)

A power series IS an infinite series but it has an $x$ term in it so it isn't just a number but now a function of $x$.

In fact, power series defines a function of $x$.

- The domain of this function is the set of all $x$ values for which the power series converges.
- Things can be difficult to tell if they are convergent or divergent.
- Every Power series converge at it's center ($b$).
	- for $x=b$, all powers of $x-b$ drop to $0$ except $c_{0}$
- Partial sum of a power series is a polynomial.
	- $S_{N} = \sum^{N}_{n=k} c_{n}(x-b)^{n} = c_{0} + c_{1}(x-b)^{1}+c_{2}(x-b)^{2}+ \dots + c_{N}(x-b)^{N}$
	- i.e. A power series is what happens to the partial sums as these limiting polynomials go to infinite degree.
		- If the Partial Sums converge to a certain value, you can have the power series converging to a certain function and you can approximate things by lower degree polynomials

#### Example
- $1+x+x^{2}+x^{3}+x^{4}+\dots = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0}x^{n}$
Geometric series with common ratio $x$ converges when $|x|<1 \implies x \in (-1,1)$ and diverges for $x$ outside the interval 
Furthermore, we know exactly what it converges to! $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0} x^{n}= \frac{1}{1-x} \quad \forall \space x \in (-1,1)$

- $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^{n} x^{n+1}}{2n+1}$
Don't panic! This is just saying does the series $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^{n} c^{n+1}}{2n+1}$ converge? If yes, for what constants c?
When iterating over variable $n$, $x$ is a constant.

If you look at this, $a_{n}$ is just an alternating sum of $exp(n+1)/poly(n)$
By the alternating series test, this converges if the absolute value (the term ignoring the $-1$ converges to 0)

That means, the exponential function will always dominate the behavior. $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{c^{n+1}}{2n+1}$ must equal $0$.

That is only true if $-1 < c \leq 1$ since for any value outside that, the exponent will run off faster but within the interval, the exponent will chase the value $0$ faster than $2n+1$ chases infinity. (in case of $-1$, the limiting value oscillates and never converges to a single value if you just look at the sum, again, it's always best to check the endpoints, as in the Ratio Test.)

But this doesn't always work. A more general way to do things is by taking the Root or Ratio test. 
Note however, Ratio and Root test are inconclusive for $L=1$ watch out for them!

#theorem Let $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0} c_{n}(x-b)^{n}$ be a power series
- There exists a real number $R \geq 0$ (or $R=\infty$) such that the series converges absolutely when $|x-b|<R$ and diverges when $|x-b| >R$ 
	- R is called the **radius of convergence** of the power series
- When $|x-b|=R$, the series may converge absolutely, converge conditionally, or diverge, or in any case the behavior must be checked directly.
- The interval on which the series converges is called the **interval of convergence**.
	- The Radius of converges is just half the interval of convergence

- If the series converges when $x=k$, then $R \geq |k-b|$ series converges absolutely for all $x$ with $|x-b|< |k-b|$
i.e. for any known mark of convergence, everything within the particular radial distance also must converge

### Example 
Find the IOC and ROC of each of the following 
- $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{x^{n}}{n!}$
By the ratio test, $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{x}{n+1}$
That converges for all $x \in (-\infty, \infty)$
hence, ROC = $\infty$

- $\sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \frac{8^{n}x^{3n}}{n}$
By the ratio test, $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{8 \cdot x^{3}}{n+1}$
Yet again, that converges for all $x \in (-\infty, \infty)$
hence, ROC = $\infty$

Do the root test and you get $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{8|x|^{3}}{\sqrt[n]{n}}$ hence $|x|<\frac{1}{2}$
Hence, ROC is $\frac{1}{2}$ and IOC is $[\frac{-1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$ (check boundary conditions)

- $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(2x-5)^{n}}{n^{2}7^{n}}$
By the ratio test, $\lim_{n \to \infty} |\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}| = \lim_{n \to \infty} |\frac{(2x-5) \cdot n^{2}}{(n+1)^{2} \cdot 7}| < 1$
Hence, $|2x-5| < 7$
$\implies -7 < 2x-5 < 7 \implies -1 < x < 6$

For $x=-1$, sum would be $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(-7)^{n}}{n^{2}7^{n}}$ which converges 

and for $x=6$ $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(7)^{n}}{n^{2}7^{n}}$
which again converges, hence, IOC is $[-1,6]$
ROC is $3.5$
