>An alternate way of describing points in space

The above representation is the Cartesian representation of a number in the cartesian plane for a function $y(x)$ plotted against $x$.

But that is not the only thing we can do.
We learned about the unit circle in trigonometry:

We can do this because we can make a little triangle with hypotenuse $R$ and angle $t$.
You can hence define a unique point with $R$ and $\theta$
But if you think about it, you can make such a triangle for each point in the plane.

The **polar coordinate** of a point $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is the point $(r, \theta)$, where $r$ is the distance from the point to the origin and $\theta$ is the counter-clockwise angle between positive $x-axis$ & the ray between origin & $P$.

So definition by the polar definition is also functional, in a sense there is a unique output for a certain input.
This **might** be particularly useful.
But the polar coordinates are NOT unique for any particular point in $x-y \space space$ in a sense that $(r, \theta) = (r, \theta + 2\pi)$

A little practice...

1. $(2, \frac{\pi}{3})$
2. $(1, \frac{7\pi}{6})$
3. $(3, \frac{11\pi}{4})$
4. $(\frac{5}{2},\frac{-3\pi}{2})$
5. $(-4,\frac{3\pi}{4})$
6. $(0,5)$

(the angle tells you the angle to traverse and $r$ tells you the distance to move along that angle (negative distances moving the opposite direction))

### Conversion between Polar and Cartesian Coordinates 
$x=rcos(\theta)$, $y=rsin(\theta)$
$r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}$, $tan(\theta)=\frac{y}{x}$

This means that the conversion is unique one way and not unique the other, as described earlier.
But can be still useful! 

Not only can points be represented as polar coordinates but also that **functions** can be very conveniently defined in polar coordinates at times.

For instance, 
$r=4$ by definition would be a circle with radius $4$, centered at the origin 
($(\frac{x}{cos(\theta)})^{2} + (\frac{y}{sin(\theta)})^{2}=16 \implies x^{2}+y^{2}=16$)
by using the parametric definition to convert between polar and Cartesian coordinates and eliminating the parameter.

$r=-2sec(\theta)$
maybe not obvious. But for such situations just play around with things and try to define $x$ and $y$ as a fucntion of $r$ and $\theta$

For instance, the above given polar equation $\implies rcos(\theta)=-2=x$ hence, this is a vertical line $x=-2$.
