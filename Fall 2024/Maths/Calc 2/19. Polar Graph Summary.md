Let $k$ be a constant 

Circles:
- $r=k$ 
	- circle of radius $k$ centered at $(0,0)$ (whole circle traced out on any interval of $\theta$ of length $2\pi$)
- $r=2kcos(\theta)$
	- circle of radius $|k|$, center is $(k,0)$ (traced out on interval of length $\pi$)
- $r=2ksin(\theta)$
	- circle of radius $|k|$, centered at $(0,k)$

Lines:
- $r=ksec(\theta)$
	- $x=k$ (vertical line)
- $r=kcsc(\theta)$
	- $y=k$ (horizontal line)
- $\theta=k$
	- line through in the origin of slope $tan(k)$ i.e. $y=tan(k)x$
- $arcos(\theta)+brsin(\theta)=c$
	- general form of line where $rcos(\theta)=x$ & $rsin(\theta)=y$ and $ax+by=c$ is the standard form in rectangular/cartesian coordinates

Use Desmos! It's fun!

## Calculus with Polar Curves!
The slope of the line tangent to the polar curve $r=f(\theta)$ at $(r, \theta)$

is $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx} \bigg|_{(r,\theta)} = \frac{f'(\theta)sin(\theta)+f(\theta)cos(\theta)}{f'(\theta)cos(\theta)-f(\theta)sin(\theta)}$


Why?
A polar curve $r=f(\theta)$
$x=rcos(\theta)$ and $y=rsin(\theta)$

So we parameterize the curve as $x=f(\theta)cos(\theta)$ and $y=f(\theta)sin(\theta)$

The, $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/d\theta}{dx/d\theta}$

#### Example 
Find the slope of the Cardioid $r=1-cos(\theta)$ at $\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}$

we do the same trick and say $x = f(\theta)cos(\theta)$ and $y=f(\theta)sin(\theta)$
$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/d\theta}{dx/d\theta} = \frac{f'(\theta)sin(\theta)+f(\theta)cos(\theta)}{f'(\theta)cos(\theta)-f(\theta)sin(\theta)}$
And hence, $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{sin(\theta)sin(\theta) + (1-cos(\theta))cos(\theta)}{sin(\theta)cos(\theta)-(1-cos(\theta))sin(\theta)}$
$\implies \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$ at $\frac{2\pi}{3}$

## Area of Polar Regions 

![[Maths/Calc 2/attachments/Drawing 24-12-04-06-27-05]]

In rectangular coordinates, you can have an integration as $\int^{b}_{a} f(x)\,dx$

![[Maths/Calc 2/attachments/Drawing 24-12-04-06-28-36]]

Here, instead of the rectangles, you use triangles or circular sector.

The idea is, the more divide the interval into smaller values of $\Delta \theta$, the better the approximations are to the area of a circular sector/triangle

and hence the area is the sum of the limiting value of $\sum \frac{1}{2}r^{2}\Delta theta$
or in terms of an integral,
The Riemann Sums of the sectors/triangles would limit to $$\int^{\theta_{2}}_{\theta_{1}} \frac{1}{2}r^{2}\, d\theta$$

#### Example 
Find the area inside $r=4sin(\theta)$
from $\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}$ and $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$
$A = \frac{1}{2}\int^{\frac{\pi}{2}}_{\frac{\pi}{4}} (4sin(\theta))^{2}\,d\theta$
$= 8 \int^{\frac{\pi}{2}}_{\frac{\pi}{4}} \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}cos(2 \theta) d \theta = \pi + 2$

![[Maths/Calc 2/attachments/Drawing 24-12-04-06-38-00]]

Hence, as we take smaller $d \theta$ steps, the triangle becomes a better and better approximation to the actual area (since $\theta \approx sin(\theta) \approx tan(\theta)$ for small angles.)

- Set up an integral to find the area inside the flower $r=sin(3 \theta)$

![[Maths/Calc 2/attachments/Drawing 24-12-04-06-47-01]]

What are the bounds?

One thing we often can take advantage of in polar curves is Symmetry!

We want first bounds for the first petal. For that, we see what is happening, the function is tracing a moving value of radius over an angle. So need to solve for 2 consecutive values of $\theta$ for which $r=0$

$\implies$ solution for $sin(3\theta)=0$ the first 2 angles that do that are $0$ and $\frac{\pi}{3}$

Hence, $Area = 3 \int^{\frac{\pi}{3}}_{0} \frac{1}{2}sin^{2}(3 \theta) \,d\theta$

You can not simply say $0$ to $2\pi$ since curves may loop around multiple times, giving you double/triple counting areas.

#def The area inside a polar curve $r=f(\theta)$ and outside $r=g(\theta)$ from $\theta = \alpha$ to $\theta = \beta$ is 
$\frac{1}{2} \int^{\beta}_{\alpha} ((f(\theta))^{2} - (g(\theta))^{2}) \, d\theta$
