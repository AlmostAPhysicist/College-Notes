## Arc Length 
![[Maths/Calc 2/attachments/Drawing 24-09-18-05-39-49|1000]]

We can find the total length to be sum of different lengths.

Say you can any two points on the curve ($(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_i+\Delta x, y_i+\Delta y)$).
The straight line distance would be $\sqrt{\Delta x^{2} + \Delta y^2}$


Hence, the total curve length = $\sum^{n}_{i=1} \sqrt{(\Delta x_i)^2,(\Delta y_i)^2}$
$=\sum^{n}_{i=1} \sqrt{1+(\frac{\Delta y_i}{\Delta x_{i}})^{2}\,}(\Delta x_i)$
So the length of the curve is 
$\displaystyle L = \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum^{n}_{i=1} \sqrt{1+(\frac{\Delta y_i}{\Delta x_{i}})^{2}\,}(\Delta x_i)$
$$\displaystyle L = \int^{b}_{a} \sqrt{1+(\frac{dy}{dx})^{2}\,}\,(dx)= \int^{d}_{c} \sqrt{(\frac{dx}{dy})^{2} + 1\,}\,(dy)$$
$$L= \int^{b}_{a} \sqrt{1+f'(x)^{2}\,}dx=\int^{d}_{c}\sqrt{1+g'(y)^2}\,dy$$
where $g(y)=x$ on $[c,d]$

## Example 
Find the length of the curve $y=4x^{3/2}$ from $x=0$ to $x=1$
$\dot{y}= 6x^{1/2}$
$\implies L = \int^{1}_{0} \sqrt{1+(6x^{1/2})^2}\,dx$
$\implies L = \int^{1}_{0} \frac{1}{36} \int^{37}_{1} \sqrt{u}\,du= \frac{1}{54}(37^{3/2}-1)$

Given a function $f(t)$, $a\leq t \leq b$ we can define the arc length function $S(x) = \int^{x}_{x} \sqrt{1 + (f'(t))^2}\,dt$
then $\displaystyle \frac{ds}{dx}= \frac{d}{dx}(\int^{x}_{x} \sqrt{1 + (f'(t))^{2}}\,dt)= \sqrt{1 + (f'(x))^{2}}= \frac{ds}{dx}$

this is called the arc length differential

$$ds = \sqrt{1 + (f'(x))^{2}}\,dx$$
Sometimes we can write integrals as $\int g(x)\,ds$ where $ds$ is the arc length differential. $$\implies \int^{b}_{a} g(x)\, \sqrt{1 + (f'(x))^{2}}\,dx$$
Such as in:

## Surface Areas 
![[Maths/Calc 2/attachments/Drawing 24-09-18-06-31-03|1000]]
Hence the surface area is the Reimann sum of trapezoids ($\displaystyle \frac{1}{2} (avg( \text{parallel sides}) \cdot height) = \pi (f(x_i)-f(x_{i+1}))\Delta s$)

Hence, integrating for $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum^{n}_{i=1} \pi (f(x_i)-f(x_{i+1}))\Delta s$
we get $$\text{Surface Area} = 2\pi\int^{b}_{a} f(x)\,ds = 2\pi\int^{b}_{a} f(x)\sqrt{1 + (f'(x))^{2}}\,dx$$
>Essentially, the surface area is the sum of arc lengths, rotated around in circles. Hence, it's the integral $\int 2\pi r \, ds$ where $ds$ is not a nudge in $x$ but arc lengths.

>So the surface area is the sum $\int 2\pi r \cdot \text{(arc length)} = \int 2\pi f(x) \cdot \text{(arc length)}$

The reason you have it wrt $ds$ and not $dx$ is you get a trapezoidal shape and not a cylinder. You leave out on bits with $dx$.

Also, it just makes sense that ahaa! The surface area is a dimensional extension of the arc lengths so we integrate arc lengths scaled by the function they are scaled up by ($2\pi r$).

**For Volume, you need orthogonal distances and hence $dx$ works, Note how rectangles and parallelograms have the same areas but not the same parameters**

When revolving around x-axis,
$SA = 2\pi \int y\,ds$
$$SA = 2\pi \int^{b}_{a} y\sqrt{1+(\frac{dy}{dx})^{2}\,}\,(dx)= 2\pi\int^{d}_{c} y\sqrt{(\frac{dx}{dy})^{2} + 1\,}\,(dy)$$

Revolving around y-axis, your radius is the $x$ value and $$SA=2\pi \int^{b}_{a} x\,ds$$

$R(x)$ can be any funky function, it is your movement along the integrating element $dx$ that always moves linearly. $R(x)$ is perpendicular to $dx$.
In case of [[Maths/Calc 2/2. Applications of Integrals#^6319ed|Shell Method]], your radius IS in the same direction as your integrating element, that is why you have to have it as a linear function only.

So if the function is rotated around the y-axis, the radius is moving out as a function of $x$.

If the function is rotated around the x-axis, the R(y) would by just a linear function of $y$ and it would be useful to setup the integral as that of $dy$.
