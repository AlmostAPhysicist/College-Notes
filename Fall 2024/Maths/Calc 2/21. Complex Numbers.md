Over time, we start realizing a common theme in mathematics that everything that we consider to be "illegal" or "ugly" at first turn out to be quite sensible, as you develop a broader concept in mathematics.

It can be anything from the first time you think of Negative Numbers, fractions, Square Roots and now even Complex Numbers... the topic for today.

## Number Theory Set Notation 
$\mathbb{N}$ (natural numbers $1,2,3,4, \dots$)
$\mathbb{Z}$ (integers $\dots, -2, 1, 0, 1, 2, \dots$)
$\mathbb{Q}$ (rational numbers $\frac{a}{b}$, $a,b$ are integers, $b \neq 0$)
$\mathbb{R}$ (real numbers — set of all possible decimal expansions/numbers whose squares give you a number in the positive part of the Real space (recursive definition!?))

Now, Back to ![[Maths/Calc 1/Number Wizardry - Relations and Functions#^1073f2|Number Wizardry - Relations and Functions]]

What is the $\sqrt{-1}$?

This does not fit in any category mentioned before.
Like before, we now define a new category of numbers… complex numbers.

#def We start by defining the number **Imaginary number** $i:i^{2}=-1$
#def Hence, a **Complex number** ($\mathbb{C}$) is a number of form $a + bi$ where $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $i^{2}=-1$

What about $\sqrt{i}$? Well we actually do not need to go beyond this space!

The Complex Space is algebraically closed, i.e., you can find solutions to all polynomials defined in the complex space within the complex space.

All real numbers themselves are themselves complex numbers whose Imaginary Part is $0$.
$8+27i$
$\sqrt{3}+\pi i$
these are all Complex Numbers

## Arithmetic Operations on Complex Numbers 

It is literally the same as any arithmetic operation in an algebraic expression. Treat $i$ is a variable and then during evaluation, use $i^{2}=-1$ for simplification if possible.

$(3+2i)+(5-3i)=8-i$
$(3+2i)(5-3i)=15+10i-9i-6i^{2} = 15+i-6(-1)=21+i$

#def If $z=a+bi$ is a complex $\#$

A complex number of form $bi$, $b \in \mathbb{R}$ is (purely) Imaginary. A complex number of form $a$, $a \in \mathbb{R}$ is (purely) Real.

So a complex number $z \in \mathbb{C} = Real(z) + Imaginary(z)i = a + bi$
often, $Real(z)=Re(z)$ and $Imaginary(z)=Im(z)$

(remember... imaginary part, by definition only includes the real component/weight of the imaginary space!)

#def A **complex conjugate** of $z$, often written as $\bar{z}$ is $a-bi$

The motivation for defining such a thing is because $z \bar{z} = a^{2}-b^{2}i^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}$

#def The **absolute value** or modulus or magnitude or length… of a complex number is defined to be its physical length from the origin $(0,0)$ when you physically plot it.
It is defined as $a^{2}+b^{2}$.

Note, you would use distance to be an underlying definition, but it just turns out, as talked sometime before, the axiomatic form of math forces us to have definitions in a way that Euclidean math works. Pythagorean theorem is actually the way we define Euclidean Space, not the other way around as it just turns out.

If not noticed, $|z| = \sqrt{z \bar{z}}$

### Example 
$|-4+3i| = \sqrt{4^{2}+ 3^{2}}=5$

Division... hmmm..
$z=\frac{2-i}{-4+3i}$ we first rationalize the denominator by multiplying by the complex conjugate.

$z = \frac{(2-i)(-4-3i)}{(-4+3i)(-4-3i)}$
$=\frac{(2-i)(-4-3i)}{|z|^{2}}$
$= \frac{-8+4i-6i-3}{5^{2}} = \frac{-11-2i}{25}$
$= \frac{-11}{25} - \frac{2}{25}i$

## Plotting Complex Numbers 

Complex numbers live nowhere on the Number line.

**To see the beautiful complex numbers, you have to broaden the horizon of your sight, moving from the number line into the complex plane.**

You would then plot the point $(a+bi)$ in the complex plane of the Real vs Imaginary Values/Axes as a simple $(a,b)$ number

## Complex Numbers as Vectors 

The addition of complex numbers is similar to addition of vectors where you would just parallel transport the vectors and get a resultant vector by the parallelogram rule.
![[Maths/Calc 2/attachments/Drawing 24-12-11-05-45-41]]
This comes in handy by it's converse... It turns out treating vectors as complex numbers can at times be rather useful, especially for rotations. Although rotations are indeed encapsulated by Linear Algebra anyways.

## Complex Numbers and Polar form
Points in the xy-plane can be described in polar coordinates.
So we can describe complex numbers in their polar form too.

If $z=x+iy$, then $x=rcos(\theta)$, $y=rsin(\theta)$

$\implies z = rcos(\theta)+rsin(\theta)$
$\implies z = r(cos(\theta)+sin(\theta))$

in a previous workshop, using Taylor expansion of the $exp(x)=e^{x}$ function and $sin(x)$ and $cos(x)$, we proved $cos(\theta)+sin(\theta)=e^{i\theta}$

Hence, $$z=re^{i\theta}$$
#def Let $z=x+iy$ 
The **polar form** of $z$ is $z=re^{i\theta}$, where $r=|z|$ and $\theta$ is the counter-clockwise angle between $z$ and positive real axis.

---

### Example 
$z=-4+4i$ 
$|z|=\sqrt{(-4)^{2}+4^{2}} = \sqrt{32}$
$tan(\theta)=\frac{4}{-4}=-1$
$\implies \theta = \frac{3\pi}{4}$
(Often you will tell the magnitude of $\alpha$ by this and the actual angle theta would be eyeballed by the relative sign of $x$ and $y$)

Hence, $z = \sqrt{32}e^\frac{3\pi i}{4}$

---
## Why care about polar form?
It is not just cosmetics of a number for which we write it in a polar form. But rather, the polar form helps us exploit exponential rules to very conveniently multiply and divide numbers.

for instance, $(-4+4i)^{5}$ could be figured out by foiling everything out.

But we can write that as $(\sqrt{32}e^{\frac{3\pi i}{4}})^{5}=32^{\frac{5}{2}}e^{\frac{15\pi i}{4}}$  

**In essence, Multiplying Complex numbers is like scaling/multiplying their lengths and add their angles.**

Simply because that is how exponents work — adding the angles.

---

A neat thing about this is since exponents are just multiplying the powers, square-rooting is just dividing the powers.

Which means that if $z^{2}=r^{2}e^{2\theta i}$
$\implies \sqrt{z}=\sqrt{r}e^{\frac{\theta i}{2}}$

Ahaa!!
![[Maths/Calc 2/attachments/Drawing 24-12-11-06-16-09]]

This is exactly what is means to be closed. So any polynomial of degree $n$ in the Complex space WILL HAVE $n$ solutions.

Note, that actually your solutions are infinite since any angle that is $2\pi$ larger would still be valid. But it is no longer useful. So only $n$ **distinct** solutions are possible.


The way you actually find these for a polynomial $z^{n} = re^{i\theta}$
You can say $z^{n}=re^{i\theta},re^{i\theta+2\pi}, re^{i\theta+4\pi}, \dots$

Hence, $z = r^{\frac{1}{n}}e^{\frac{i\theta}{n}}, r^{\frac{1}{n}}e^{\frac{i\theta+2\pi}{n}},r^{\frac{1}{n}}e^{\frac{i\theta+4\pi}{n}},\dots$

For any term greater than $n$, you would start seeing powers like $e^{\frac{i\theta}{n}+2\pi}$
which no longer makes the complex number unique.
Hence, you can have and will have $n$ unique solutions.

### Example 
Find all solutions to $z^{6}=-64$

![[Maths/Calc 2/attachments/Drawing 24-12-11-06-27-34]]

Hence, we have $r^{6} = 64$ and $6\theta=\pi+2\pi k$
$\implies r = 2$
and $\theta = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{2\pi k}{6}$
$\implies \theta = \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{5\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{11\pi}{6}$
(note how $\frac{13\pi}{6}$ would bring us back to $\frac{\pi}{6}$)

Hence, solution to $z^{6}=-64$ would be $z=re^{i\theta}$
where the above are the values of $r$ and $\theta$.

---
#funfact Figure out what $i^{i}$ is.

$i = e^{i(\frac{\pi}{2})}$
$\implies i^{i} = e^{i(\frac{\pi}{2})i} = e^\frac{-\pi}{2}$
which, if you notice is a real number!

## Stress on Number of Solutions 

A polynomial $P(x)$ ($x \in \mathbb{R}$) where $deg(P(x))=k$ would have anywhere from $0$ to $k$ roots. But polynomial $P(z)$ $(z \in \mathbb{C})$ would have exactly $k$ distinct roots.

This in fact, is the **Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**.
>If $P(z)$ is a non-constant polynomial over the complex numbers of degree k then $P(z)$ has exactly k roots, counting multiplicity.

(Multiplicity means not distinct… so $P(z) = (z-a)^{2}(z-b)^{3}$ is valid for a degree 5 polynomial)

This also mean you can factor every polynomial into linear factors.

#funfact 
That doesn't mean to solutions are trivial now. In fact, it has been proven that for at least a degree 5 polynomial, you can NOT have a general formula for all the solutions.

The fundamental theorem of algebra - pretty much like fundamental theorem of arithmetic is just the fact that we can factor polynomials, just as each number can be factored as a multiple of prime numbers as per the fundamental theorem of Arithmetic. Usually, "fundamental" theorems in mathematics are about a certain structure that a mathematical object can be broken down into.
