## Example 
- Set up a polar integral  to compute the area to the right of $x=2$ and inside $x^{2}+y^{2}=16$

Essentially, the Areas and integrals for polar curves work the same as a normal area for a rectangular integral. 

Note however, you are not moving linearly but radially. You don't integrate the area under the curve and between the curve and the x-axis but rather, the area within a region subtended by the radial lines and the curve.

Just like you would subtract the integral of the line underneath from the line above to find a difference of integrals, you subtract the integral of curve **closer to $(0,0)$**.

Hence, the general $Area = \int \frac{1}{2}r^{2}\,d\theta$
$\implies \text{Area we want} = \frac{1}{2} \int^{\frac{\pi}{3}}_{\frac{-\pi}{3}} ((4)^{2} - (2sec(\theta))^{2})\, d\theta = \int^{\frac{\pi}{3}}_{\frac{-\pi}{3}} (16 - 4sec^{2}(\theta))\, d\theta$

## Why do this?
We can and have done this before in rectangular coordinates. But notice how this integral is a much simpler integral that the other tedious rectangular integral. 

By changing the space... i.e. by a slight shift of perspectives, you can have a more convenient space to work with.

- Setup a polar integral to calculate area outside $r=3$ and inside $r=6sin(\theta)$

1. Recognizing what these are
$r=3$ is just a circle of radius $3$.

$r=6sin(\theta) \implies r^{2} = 6y = x^{2}+y^{2} \implies x^{2}+(y-3)^{2}=3^{2}$

In general, $r = acos(\theta) + bsin(\theta)$
is a circle that passes through the origin since $acos(\theta)+bsin(\theta)=0$ will always have a solution by continuity.

with center $(a,b)$

$r=acos(\theta) + bsin(\theta) \iff (x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}$

So essentially, the required required integral can be $\frac{1}{2} \int^{\frac{5\pi}{6}}_{\frac{pi}{6}} ((6sin(\theta))^{2}-(3)^{2})\, d\theta$
(you get the boundary conditions, just as in rectangular curves, by setting the functions equal to one another and solving for the answer.)

Often, for things like a lens, you may want to play around with geometry - either subtracting things from other, known areas or introducing new geometrical objects that help you calculate things.

## Polar Arc Length 
The general arc length, simply by following from Pythagorean theorem,

$L = \int \sqrt{dx^{2}+dy^{2}}$

This, for parametric equations we solve as $\int \sqrt{(\frac{dx}{dt})^{2} + (\frac{dy}{dt})^{2}}\,dt$ (essentially dividing through by $dt$)

For polar curve, remember $r = f(\theta)$, $\alpha \leq \theta \leq \beta$

can be parametrized as $x = rcos(\theta)$, $y = rsin(\theta)$

Hence, $L = \int^{\beta}_{\alpha} \sqrt{(\frac{d(rcos(\theta))}{d\theta})^{2}+(\frac{d(rsin(\theta))}{d\theta})^{2}}\,d\theta$
which, applying product rule, collecting like terms and $sin^{2}(\theta)+cos^{2}(\theta)=1$, 

$L = \int^{\beta}_{\alpha} \sqrt{r^{2} + (\frac{dr}{d\theta})^{2}}\,d\theta$

### Example 
Let us look at the length of a spiral $r=\theta^{2}$ for $\theta=0$ to $\theta = \sqrt{5}$
```desmos-graph
r=\theta^2
```

$L = \int^{\sqrt{5}}_{0} \sqrt{(\theta^{2})^{2} + (2\theta)^{2}}\, d\theta$
$= \int^{\sqrt{5}}_{0}\theta\sqrt{\theta^{2}+4}\,d\theta$
which is just a $u-sub$ and happens to be $\frac{19}{3}$!
