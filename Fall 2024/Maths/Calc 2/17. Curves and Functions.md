We know from [[Maths/Calc 1/Number Wizardry - Relations and Functions|Number Wizardry - Relations and Functions]] that this is not a function of $x$ since functions only map 1 input to 1 output.

But such curves are very natural to be studied in nature. For example, this could be a path of some person walking across the town.

The way we can describe some curves is to define a third super parameter that alters both the $x$ and $y$ values.

#def Suppose that $f(t)$ & $g(t)$ are two functions of the variable $t$ for $a \leq t \leq b$ and $x=f(t)$ and $y=g(t)$
The set of all points $(f(t), g(t))$ for $a \leq t \leq b$ is called a **parametric curve**. The equations $x=f(t)$ & $y=g(t)$ are called parametric equations for the curve.

- $t$ (or any other variable for that matter) is called the **parameter**
- $[a,b]$ is the **parameter interval**
	- $(f(a), g(a))$ is the initial point 
	- $(f(b), g(b))$ is the terminal point 
- To **parameterize** the curve $C$ is to find parametric equations & interval that trace out $C$
	- The equations and intervals and equations together are called the parameterization of $C$

#### Example 
- Describe the parametric curve $x=2cos(t), y=2sin(t), \quad 0 \leq t \leq 2\pi$
we'll figure how to transform this into the Cartesian form (into an actual curve) later but first lets understand the intuition...


| t       | x          | y          |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| $0$     | $2$        | $0$        |
| $\pi/4$ | $\sqrt{2}$ | $\sqrt{2}$ |
| $\pi/2$ | $0$        | $2$        |
Mapping few points like that tells us that…

Notice how not only does the parameterization give you the curve but also the direction of travel since increasing $t$ makes you traverse the curve in the counter-clockwise direction.
You can also traverse the curve more than once!

Now how can we be for sure that this is a circle?

We can learn what the curve is by **eliminating the parameter** by either substitution or by finding a relation between the variables that the particular system satisfies.

In our case, since $sin^2(x)+cos^2(x)=1$, $x(t)^{2} + y(t)^{2} = 2sin^{2}(x)+2cos^{2}(x)=2=x^2+y^2$

#### Example problems 
1. $x=t, y=e^{t}, \quad -1 \leq t \leq 1$
$\implies y(x) = y^{x}$
![[Maths/Calc 2/attachments/Drawing 24-11-25-06-16-38]]
2. $x=2t^{4},y=t^{2}, \quad -1 \leq t \leq 1$
$\implies x = 2y^{2}$
![[Maths/Calc 2/attachments/Drawing 24-11-25-06-17-14]]
3. $x=4sin(2t),y=5cos(2t), \quad 0 \leq t \leq 2 \pi$
$\implies \frac{x}{4}= sin(2t)$
$\implies \frac{y}{5}=cos(2t)$
$\implies (\frac{x}{4})^{2} + (\frac{y}{5})^{2} = 1$
This is an ellipse!

### Calculus of Parametric Curves 
The reason we care about parametric curves is that we often want to operate on curves that can not be represented by a function. 

( #cheesy A parametric equation is just a vector equation of a curve)

Let $x=f(t), y=g(t), \quad a \leq t \leq b$
Two "natural" derivates $\frac{dx}{dt}$ & $\frac{dy}{dt}$ 
$\frac{dx}{dt}$ is the horizontal change in curve wrt $t$
$\frac{dy}{dx}$ is the horizontal change in curve wrt $t$

But neither of them are the standard $\frac{dy}{dx}$.

Obviously, you can find this as an implicit differential by treating the derivatives as just fractions - because that is what they are.

$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt},\quad \frac{dx}{dt}\neq0$
(technically for some weird reason you can't mathematically do that but whatever… for the sake of physical functions, things work!)

#### Examples 
1. $x=3sin(t),y=4cos(t), \quad 0 \leq t \leq 2 \pi$ | Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ at $(\frac{3}{2}, 2 \sqrt{3})$, Parametric Equation, All points with HTL, $\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}$

- $\frac{dx}{dt} = 3cos(t), \frac{dy}{dt} = -4sin(t)$
$\implies \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-4}{3}\frac{sin(t)}{cos(t)}$
Hence, to find $t$, we use our given values of $x$ and $y$ and see what value of $t$ satisfies these simultaneously

we get for $3 sin(t)=\frac{3}{2} \implies t=\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{5\pi}{6}$ and $4cos(t)=2\sqrt{3} \implies t= \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{11\pi}{6}$
Hence, $t = \frac{\pi}{6}$
$\implies \frac{dy}{dx}$ at $(\frac{3}{2}, 2\sqrt{3})$ $= \frac{-4}{3}tan(\frac{\pi}{6})$

- We already know this is an ellipse with $\frac{x^{2}}{9}+ \frac{y^{2}}{16}=1$
The tangent line at $t=\frac{\pi}{4}$ is going to be $y-y(t=\frac{\pi}{4})= \frac{dy}{dx}(x-x(t=\frac{\pi}{4}))$

hence, $y-2\sqrt{2} = \frac{-4}{3}(x - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2})$

For the horizontal tangent line to be zero, $\frac{dy}{dx}=0=\frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}$
Hence, $\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 = -4sin(t) \implies (0,4), (0,-4)$ are the points of horizontal tangent line 

$\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} = \frac{dy'}{dx} = \frac{dy'/dt}{dx/dt}$
$= \frac{\frac{-4}{3}sec^{2}t}{3cos(t)}$

Given a parametric curve $(x(t), y(t))$, if $y' = \frac{dy}{dx}$ then $\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} = \frac{dy'/dt}{dx/dt}$

### Integrals with parametric Equations 
Recall:
1. Signed area between $f(x)$ and $x-axis$ is $\int^{b}_{a} f(x)\,dx$
2. The Arc length of $f(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$ is $\int^{b}_{a} \sqrt{1+(f'(x))^{2}}\,dx$
3. The surface area of the surface obtained by rotating around the $x-axis$ is $\int^{b}_{a} 2\pi r ds$
	- $= \int^{b}_{a} 2\pi \int y\, ds = 2\pi \int^{b}_{a} f(x)\sqrt{1+(f'(x))^{2}}\,dx$

Quite simply, these can be translated in $t-space$ because
$x=x(t)$
$y = y(t)$
$\implies dx = x'(t)dt \qquad dy = y'(t)dt$

where $a'(t) = \frac{da}{dt}$

We learned earlier how we can translate a function as a parametric curve, now using this we can also turn a constant of integration into a certain $t-space$ (parametric space)

Hence, the area under the parametric curve $\int^{x=b}_{x=a} = y(x)\,dx$ can be translated to $\int^{t=t_{1}}_{t=t_{0}}y(t) \, x'(t)dt$

Arc length, similarly is $\int^{t_{1}}_{t_{0}} \sqrt{x'(t)^{2} + y'(t)^{2}}\, dt$

And the Surface Area is $2\pi \int^{t_{1}}_{t_{0}} y(t)\sqrt{x'(t)^{2} + y'(t)^{2}}\, dt$

(Assuming the parametric curve is traversed only once for the given bounds)

***Essentially, the idea is no different from a $u-sub$. All you are doing is changing the input space and hence the functions themselves, the constant of integration and the bounds. But the overall structure of the integral is still preserved.***

---

Hence, the area of an ellipse $x=3sin(t)$, $y=4cos(t)$, $0 \leq t \leq 2\pi$

$\displaystyle\implies Area = \int y(x)\, dx = 4\int^{\frac{\pi}{2}}_{0} y(t) \cdot (\frac{dx}{dt})dt$
$\displaystyle\implies Area = 4\int^{\frac{\pi}{2}}_{0} 4 cos(t) \cdot 3cos(t)\, dt = 24\int^{\frac{\pi}{2}}_{0} (cos(2t)+1)\, dt$
$\displaystyle \implies Area = 24 (\frac{sin(2t)}{2} + t)\bigg|^{\frac{\pi}{2}}_{0}$
$\displaystyle Area = 24(\frac{\pi}{2})+0=12\pi$

(You can prove thus that an ellipse that is strength out by $a$ units along $x-axis$ and $b$ units along the $y-axis$ is $\pi ab$)

Similarly, The length of curve parametrized by $x=t^{3}, y=\frac{3}{2}t^{2}, 0 \leq t \leq \sqrt{8}$
$\int^{\sqrt{8}}_{0} \sqrt{(3t^{2})^{2}+(3t)^{2}}dt$
$= \int^{\sqrt{8}}_{0} 3t \sqrt{t^{2}+1}\, dt$ which, solving with a $u-sub$ with $u=t^{2}+1$
$= 26$
