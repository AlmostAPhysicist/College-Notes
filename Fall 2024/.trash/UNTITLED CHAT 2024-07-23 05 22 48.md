Hi!

##### assistant
Hi there! What can I do for you today?

##### user
Who are you

##### assistant
I am a large language model, trained by Google.
Here's a bit more about me:
* **I'm trained on a massive amount of text data:** This allows me to understand and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions.
* **I can access and process information from the real world:** I can search the internet and use that information to answer your questions.
* **I'm still under development:** I'm constantly learning and improving, and I'm always working to become more helpful and informative.
What else would you like to know?

Your name?

##### assistant
I don't have a name! I'm just a helpful AI assistant. You can call me Bard, or anything you like.

Bard or Gemini

##### assistant
You're right to point that out!  I am actually a Gemini Pro model,  a more advanced version of Bard.  While Bard was a great starting point, Gemini Pro has been trained on even more data and is capable of even more complex tasks.
So, you can call me Gemini Pro, or just Gemini, if you prefer.  ðŸ˜Š

Based on your notes...
Limits are a fundamental concept in calculus. They describe the behavior of a function as its input approaches a specific value.
Here's a simple explanation:
Imagine you have a function, like  f(x) = x.  As the input (x) gets closer and closer to 0, the output (f(x)) also gets closer and closer to 0.  We say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 is equal to 0.
This is written mathematically as:
lim (x->0) f(x) = 0
It's important to note that the limit doesn't necessarily equal the value of the function at that point. For example, the function f(x) = x/x is undefined at x = 0, but its limit as x approaches 0 is 1.
Limits are crucial for understanding concepts like continuity, derivatives, and integrals, which are essential building blocks of calculus.
