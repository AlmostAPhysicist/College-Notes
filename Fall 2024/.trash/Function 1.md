Before starting out anything, here's a short write-up on what a function, at a very basic level means.

A function, is a processing unit.
It takes in an *input* and spits out an *output*. That's it. ^a5fa57

A **Real-Valued Function**, usually denoted in maths by $f(x)$, $y$ or $y(x)$ simply takes in a number, and outputs a number (unless undefined).

Figure 1 is both a function and a relation^[Definition: Any Set of Ordered Pairs of elements of a Domain and that of a Co-Domain. [details](https://brilliant.org/wiki/relations/)]


Figure 2 is only a relation. It is NOT a function. 

Functions do NOT spit out multiple values for the same input. Only many-one relations/multivalued relations do that.

A quick "Vertical Line Test" as depicted in the image can be done to see if a curve is a function or not.


# Square Roots

I would like to touch on a very special function here. The Square Root.

Once you get the gist of understanding this one, you're good.

So, here's a question:

$$x^2=4$$
$$x=\sqrt{4} \enspace or \enspace x=\pm\sqrt{4}$$
$$x=\pm2$$
which one of these is correct? Should there be a $\pm$ symbol in front of the square root or not?

Usually, we like to think that the Square-Root function is an *inverse* of the Square function. In a sense that it tends to _undo_ what the other does.
