## Coding vs. Coding Environment
Coding: Writing a computer language syntax.
Coding Environment: Thinking Logically and using a set of pseudocode^[computer-language like syntax but something readable and easy to understand (Informal and High Level but one that maintains the same structure as an actual program). eg: Read(A), Read(B), Add(A, B)] to convey ideas.

Algorithm Creation:
- Analyze
- Solve
- Evaluate
- 
Computational Thinking:
- Running through the code through your brain
- Abstraction
- Easy to read code.
- COMMUNICATE YOUR SOLUTION

Pseudo Code:
(A more detailed Look)
* The Lingo:
	- Variable
	- Constant
	- Expression
	- Boolean Expression (Evaluates to A Bool)
	- Statement (Definitions with $=$)
	- Input (reading data from Input device)
	- Output (Displaying data to a output device) ## (I/O Stream means Input/Output Stream)
- set
- compute
- read
- display
- etc 

```pseudo-code fold
#CamelCase... first letter is small and following that, first letters are Caps
READ anaCats 
READ ellenCats
COMPUTE totalCats AS anaCats + ellenCats
DISPLAY totalCats

**OR ANY OTHER LINGO YOU WANT... JUST CONVEY THE IDEA!**
READ -> COMPUTE -> DISPLAY (you might to it on the same line)
```
