# 1st Law

Practical observation:
- If there is no Force (Net Force includes Friction, Gravity, Mechanical Force, etc.) on ab object, object doesn't change its velocity (it doesn't accelerate).
- $\implies$ Total Force $=0$ $\iff$ constant velocity

Mass:
- It's a measure of Inertia^[property of object to resist change of state of motion/property of object for how it reacts to forces]

# 2nd Law 
$$Net \, Force = mass \times acceleration$$
$$\sum_{i} \vec{F_{i}}= \sum_{i}m_{i}\cdot \sum_{i} \vec{a_i}$$
Or
$$\vec{F}=m \vec{a}$$
Since these are vectors, these can be broken down in dimensional component vector equations for $x,y,z$ axes.
#funfact 
(For General Relativity, you have another component of $time$!)

Components can be $r,\theta,\phi$
or anything!

As said before, vectors are general objects, the breakdown depends on the coordinate system we use!

## SI Units 
(MKS)
(cgs is not SI)
1 N force causes 1 unit acceleration in SI units for 1 unit mass in SI units.
$1N = 1kg\cdot 1\frac{m}{s^2}$

## Free Body Diagram 
(Abstraction for having an entire system, you consider 1 single object and consider all the forces acting upon it.)

## Some Special Forces 

==**Weight** ==: 
Force of gravity $\implies mass \times gravitational\,acc$
Remember, it's a vector! It's always pointing downwards (Towards the gravitational center of the planet)

==**Tension** ==: 
Pulling upon objects — usually across strings 

==**Normal Force** ==:
An abstraction of molecular interactions caused by electrostatics and electromagnetics that opposes the motion of an object passing through a certain other object, acting perpendicular to the surface.

In case of objects laying on horizontal surfaces, the normal force is equal and opposite to the weight of the object (which is another force vector).

# 3rd Law
Say $A$ and $B$ interact^[apply forces on each other].

Force and A due to B is equal and opposite of the force on B due to A.

If all forces have equal and opposite and opposite reactions, why do things move?
	Because those opposite forces are acting on DIFFERENT objects.
