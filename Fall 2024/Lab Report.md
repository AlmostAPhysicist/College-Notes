The course website states:
>_Lab reports_ (80%)
>_Pre-lab assignments_ (20%)

$\displaystyle\implies \frac{\sum((0.8*Lab)+(0.2*PreLab))}{9}$

The formula used instead:

$\displaystyle \frac{\sum(Lab*(0.8+0.2*PreLab))}{9}$

$=\displaystyle \frac{\sum((Lab*0.8)+(0.2*Lab*PreLab))}{9}$

Hence, for any $\text{Lab Score} < 100$, The $PreLab$ weighs the score by **Less** than $20\%$ (which is not what is indicated in the course syllabus).
