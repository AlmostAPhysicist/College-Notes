We ended up earlier on defining a Flux.

We also saw that the flux of the field is a $2$ dimensional integral of a surface $\phi = \iint \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{a}$

And for a closed loop (although we didn't arrive at it this way, but rather computed things for a case and extrapolated that case for all cases), we saw that $$\phi = \iint_{closed \, surface} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{a} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_{0}}Q_{enc} = \iiint_{enclosed \, volume} \rho dv$$
and actually, mathematicians later generalized this, as we have seen in multivariable calculus for any surface integral for a closed surface, which can be converted in some kind of volume integral.

**And THAT is the differential form of Gauss's Law.**

(since it is mathematically equivalent to the integral form, albeit more condensed, it's doesn't really matter which one you prefer)
