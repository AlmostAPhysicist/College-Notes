$\text{current} := \frac{\text{Charge}}{\text{Unit Time}}$
$1 Amp = \frac{1C}{1sec}$

We can conclude from the direction of the forces that it is **Not** an electric force, but since the current is **related to the electric charge**, it is still related to it since the force measured is seen to be **proportional to the current**.

> A new phenomena! 
> Force: Magnetism

We have really seen much earlier applications of this force without truly understanding it and seeing its relation with current and charge:

A compass! 

>The reason we knew this is the same force is because while having this current in a wire, we actually saw compasses being deflected.

## Magnetic Forces 
 <u>Lorentz Force Law</u>
$$\vec{F}_{magnetic} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})$$
>Note:
>$\vec{v}, \vec{F}$ : polar vectors
>$\vec{B}$ : axial vectors (curling along)
><u>Fact check</u>

- First we will explore $q$ in $\vec{B}$
- then consider how moving charges themselves produce $\vec{B}$

> Note:
> <u>Magnetostatics</u> := moving charges but steady currents

### Cycloid Motion 
Include a uniform $\vec{E}$ field along with our $\vec{B}$ field.

$\vec{B} = (B,0,0)$
$\vec{E} = (0,0,E)$

$\vec{r}(t=0) = (0,0,0)$
$\vec{v}(t=0)=(0,0,0)$
