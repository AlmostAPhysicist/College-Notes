$\vec{B}$

So what do we know about the Magnetic Field $\vec{B}$?

- Since $\vec{F}_{B} = q \cdot [\vec{v} \times \vec{B}]$
	- Since $\vec{F}$ is a vector, $\vec{v}$ is a vector, due to the properties of the cross product, $\vec{B}$ must be a pseudovector (just how $\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{v}$ is a pseudovector)
- On a tiny piece of wire, a Magnetic field applies some force![[Electromagnetism/attachments/Drawing 25-11-11-03-58-07]]
	- $d\vec{F}_{B} = dq [\vec{u} \times \vec{B}] = I [d\vec{l} \times \vec{B}]$


We would now see how to model the phenomenological fact of a wire generating its own $\vec{B}$ field.
