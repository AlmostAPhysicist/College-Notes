$$\nabla^{2}V = \frac{-\rho}{\epsilon_{0}}$$
So far, we have been proving uniqueness using it. And then finding and discussing nice, tricks to use and appreciate symmetries in boundary conditions to solve for a configuration of charge density. And through uniqueness we say that that IS the solution to the system.
