So we have now defined our Electro and Magneto statics.

$$\cases{\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{B} = 0, \quad \vec{B} = \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A}(\vec{r}) \\ \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{B}= \mu_{0}\vec{j}}$$
$$\cases{\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_{0}} \rho, \quad \vec{E}= - \vec{\nabla}V(\vec{r}) \\ \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{E}= 0, \quad \nabla^{2}V = \frac{-1}{\epsilon_{0}} \rho}$$

$\vec{B} = \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A}(\vec{r})$
Note, here $\vec{A}$ is the Magnetic vector potential.

Just like the electric field has an electric scalar potential (the voltage $V$), the magnetic field has a magnetic vector potential.

It doesn't have such a nice relation with energy as the electric potential, but let's see what kind of differential equation pops out of it, just the way for the scalar electric potential, we got the poison equation.
