As with much of the literature on Quantum Mechanics, I would like to start with a little history, through the lens of Old Quantum Theory, for I believe, these historical sets of events give a true sense and understanding of why Quantum Mechanics currently is the way it is.

## Recap of the Old Quantum Theory
>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics is unironically an excellent source on this

It starts with **Max Plank** stepping in to find a fix to the **Ultraviolet Catastrophe** by introducing, as motivated by the **quantization of harmonic modes of oscillators** in a finite system, a **quanta** of the radiation emitted by a black body and using some Boltzmann statistics.

Predictions of the amount of thermal radiation of different frequencies emitted by a body. Correct values predicted by Planck's law (green) contrasted against the classical values of [Rayleigh-Jeans law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Jeans_law "Rayleigh–Jeans law") (red) and [Wien approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien_approximation "Wien approximation") (blue).


The next feat comes from **Albert Einstein**, with his insight on the well known **Photoelectric Effect**.

Einstein's insight was that this quantization must not have been a property of the method of emission, but of light itself!

>According to the assumption to be contemplated here, when a light ray is spreading from a point, the energy is not distributed continuously over ever-increasing spaces, but consists of a finite number of "energy quanta" that are localized in points in space, move without dividing, and can be absorbed or generated only as a whole.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-Eistein-photoelectric-17]

Other phenomena such as Compton Scattering also provided good reason to give weight to the particle (quantized) nature of light (I like to think that the quantization comes in handy whenever light is *interacting* with matter)

Niels Bohr gives his contribution with his model of the atom^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model] which try to explain the question about the stability of the atom as well as emission and absorption spectra. (Really, the question about the stability isn't answered, and would continue to be pushed until we reach Quantum Field theory, since in all the following models, the electron, whatever it is, would have some kind of (angular) momentum around the nucleus and even though accelerating charges lose energy in form of light, the atom would somehow remain stable). The model proposes quantization in angular momentum, radius, Energy as well as velocity, as opposed to classical models where particles could take any time evolutionary value of these quantities from a continuous space.

This tends to further the notion of quantization of quantities that we classically modelled as continuous.

> A Note on when probabilities are introduced in the picture:
> Although the true nature of the Photoelectric effect is even more nuanced than how some high-school/college courses treat it:
> i.e. it is probabilistic! The probability of photoemission as a function of an electron, as a function of the energy of an individual photon is NOT a step function. The probability does NOT immediately increase to 1. Instead, there are more complicated ways to model it. One of the simpler ones of those models, is calculating the cross-section^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(physics)] of the process, which is a function of the energy. In other words, its not as simple as as long as photons have enough energy, they would a hundred percent emit photoelectrons. Changing the wavelength can not only change the maximum kinetic energies of the photoelectrons, but also the number itself, which is something often neglected when introducing this topic!
>
> Regardless, the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, as far as I can tell, did not come into being, at least in its full form, until Max Born's 1926 paper, as we will discuss in more detail later.

The quantization of (orbital) angular momentum of electrons, was set to be tested by [Otto Stern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Stern "Otto Stern") and [Walther Gerlach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_Gerlach) in their famous [Stern–Gerlach experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment "Stern–Gerlach experiment"). They had expected, based on the "space quantization", for the silver atom beam to split into certain discrete lines (or not: a continuous split would mean that classical models were more apt here). They saw the beam splitting into 2 different bands, concluding that Bohr's claims of a space quantization (angular momentum quantization) are correct. In reality, the orbital angular momentum of electrons in silver atoms is actually zero, so they should NOT have seen that. The splitting they saw was a result of what would later be known as particle **spin**. Regardless, they saw some kind of quantization happen in the angular momenta of electrons.

>Relative to its northern pole, pointing up, down, or somewhere in between, in classical mechanics, a magnet thrown through a magnetic field may be deflected a small or large distance upwards or downwards. The atoms that Stern and Gerlach shot through the magnetic field acted similarly. However, while the magnets could be deflected variable distances, the atoms would always be deflected a constant distance either up or down. This implied that the property of the atom that corresponds to the magnet's orientation must be quantized, taking one of two values (either up or down), as opposed to being chosen freely from any angle.
>
>The choice of the orientation of the magnetic field used in the Stern–Gerlach experiment is arbitrary. In the animation shown here, the field is vertical and so the atoms are deflected either up or down. If the magnet is rotated a quarter turn, the atoms are deflected either left or right. Using a vertical field shows that the spin along the vertical axis is quantized, and using a horizontal field shows that the spin along the horizontal axis is quantized.
>
>The results of the Stern-Gerlach experiment caused a sensation, most especially because leading scientists, including Einstein and [Paul Ehrenfest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ehrenfest "Paul Ehrenfest") argued that the silver atoms should have random orientations in the conditions of the experiment: quantization should not have been observable.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-cigar-34) At least five years would elapse before this mystery was resolved: quantization was observed but it was not due to orbital angular momentum. Per [Wolfgang Pauli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli "Wolfgang Pauli")'s [exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle "Pauli exclusion principle"), only two electrons can occupy the same quantum state at the same time, and their spins must be opposite. Pauli received the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physics for his "decisive contribution through his discovery of a new law of Nature, the exclusion principle or Pauli principle".^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-35]
>
>In 1925, [Ralph Kronig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Kronig "Ralph Kronig") proposed that electrons behave as if they self-rotate, or "spin", about an axis.  Spin would generate a tiny magnetic moment that would split the energy levels responsible for spectral lines, in agreement with existing measurements. Two electrons in the same orbital would occupy distinct [quantum states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state "Quantum state") if they "spun" in opposite directions thus satisfying the exclusion principle. Unfortunately, the theory had two significant flaws: two values computed by Kronig were off by a factor of two. Kronig's senior colleagues discouraged his work and it was never published.
>
>Ten months later, Dutch physicists [George Uhlenbeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Uhlenbeck "George Uhlenbeck") and [Samuel Goudsmit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goudsmit "Samuel Goudsmit") at [Leiden University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_University "Leiden University") published their theory of electron self rotation. The model, like Kronig's was essentially classical but resulted in a quantum prediction.


On the other end, motivated from the particle nature of light, and the works of Einstein and Plank, combining them in what would earlier be incompatible regimes due to the massless nature of light: $E \overset{ \tiny{\text{Einstein}}}{=} mc^{2} \overset{\tiny{\text{Plank}}}{=} \frac{hc}{\lambda} \implies mc = \frac{h}{\lambda}$, [Louis de Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie) brought out ideas about matter waves, generalizing the principle as $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$, defining an associated wave for all particles with a momentum. This very nicely fit with Bohr's claims of angular momentum quantization by defining electrons such that their waves encircle the atom. Among other contributions, this contribution of the wave-particle duality of light was fundamental to what was to come over the next few decades. 

The experimental evidence of such matter waves, first notably came from the [Davisson–Germer experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davisson%E2%80%93Germer_experiment) (which was actually an accidental experiment at what would today be Bell Labs, whose seeds were laid initially do study the surface of nickel), where electrons, scattered by the surface of a crystal of nickel metal, displayed a diffraction pattern similar to what you would expect from other waves such as light or sound.

## Modern Quantum Mechanics

>The end of the first era of quantum mechanics was triggered by de Broglie's publication of his hypothesis of [matter waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave "Matter wave")  leading to not just one new quantum theory but two. Almost simultaneously, the German physicists [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg"), [Max Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born "Max Born"), and [Pascual Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascual_Jordan "Pascual Jordan") developed [matrix mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_mechanics "Matrix mechanics") and the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger invented [wave mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation"). Schrödinger subsequently showed that the two approaches were equivalent.
>
>The first applications of quantum mechanics to physical systems were the algebraic determination of the hydrogen spectrum by [Wolfgang Pauli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli "Wolfgang Pauli") and the treatment of diatomic molecules by [Lucy Mensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Mensing "Lucy Mensing"). Accurate predictions of the absorption spectrum of hydrogen ensured wide acceptance of the new quantum theory.
>
>Starting around 1927, Paul Dirac began the process of unifying quantum mechanics with [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") by proposing the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation") for the electron. The Dirac equation achieves the relativistic description of the wavefunction of an electron that Schrödinger failed to obtain. It predicts electron spin and led Dirac to predict the existence of the [positron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron "Positron"). He also pioneered the use of operator theory, including the influential [bra–ket notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation "Bra–ket notation"), as described in his famous 1930 textbook.
>
>During the same period, Hungarian polymath [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann") formulated a mathematical basis for quantum mechanics as the theory of linear operators on Hilbert spaces, as described in his [Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Foundations_of_Quantum_Mechanics "Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics") textbook. These, like many other works from the founding period, still stand, and remain widely used.

Really, from here on, you could go off on different tangents with Matrix Mechanics, Wave Mechanics, Transformation Theory, the different interpretations of Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Field Theory, Quantum Information Theory, and what not. 

Our goal, here, is to understand some of the motivations for what sprung all the discussions in these vast oceans of ideas, as well as understand and work out some of the details for a few of these.
