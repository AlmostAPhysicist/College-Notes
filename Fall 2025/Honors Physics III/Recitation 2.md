The simultaneity stuff for special relativity is the same thing (in concept), as you standing closer to one door and faster than the other, and doors open at the same time, then light from one reaches you first and light from the 2nd door reaches you last, therefore, for you, it would appear that the 2nd door opened after the other.

This might seem like an optical illusion, but really, is it?

Who is to say something happened if you didn't observe it? If, by any means you try, whether you set up atomic clocks that are synced up, or setup cameras, or setup people, the fastest means (as per special relativity), for any event to be observed. Therefore, **For an observer, deciding whether something happened or not, can only come down to having means in their reference frame (either alone, or using other objects that are stationary in their reference frame) to observe the event. The fastest way, to our knowledge to do this is by observing the light from an event. So if the light from one event for all observes in one reference frame comes before light from another event for all observes in that reference frame, the two events are NOT simultaneous. They have no way to dispute this. In another reference frame, the events may be happening simultaneously, but WHO IS TO SAY ONE REFERENCE FRAME IS MORE CORRECT THAN THE OTHER?**

Time dilation happens in one reference frame, and length contraction happens in the other.
