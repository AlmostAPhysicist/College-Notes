Ahhh That makes sense!


So I have a bunch of particles at certain temperature, they have particular mu, and particular distribution.

They are always finite at the excited state.

When I add additional particles, they get pushed to higher and higher excited states, increasing Nex and also mu.

But mu can only go so far for the terms to not reach a singular value. And it turns out that the critical case of mu reaching the ground state energy (not zero really, but that ground state energy) would be achieved at a finite temperature (I think mu=0 would be reached at T=0, but since the bound is just the ground state energy, it would be reached at a finite temperature). And since it is reached, adding more particles have nowhere to go, since we have reched a maximum capacity of the excited states as per the statistics.

(except for N0, the ground state, which has already diverged)

And hence, all additional particles go to the ground state.

This rises proportional to the total number of particles, and hence can be seen as a macroscopic phenomena, with interesting properties due to all particles sharing the same quantum state.


Additionally, the higher the density, the more clustered these particles are, the faster this equilibrium point is reached.
And then the further down you go in temperature from this critical point, the higher fraction of particles are in the ground state, but point being that there are still many already, and proportionally rising that are in the ground state now.
