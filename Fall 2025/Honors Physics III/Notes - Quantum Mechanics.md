[Wikipedia on Schrödinger's Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation)

>The **Schrödinger equation** is a [partial differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation") that governs the [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function "Wave function") of a non-relativistic quantum-mechanical system.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation#cite_note-Griffiths2004-1): 1–2  Its discovery was a significant landmark in the development of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). It is named after [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger"), an Austrian physicist, who postulated the equation in 1925 and published it in 1926, forming the basis for the work that resulted in his [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") in 1933.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation#cite_note-sch-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation#cite_note-4)

>Conceptually, the Schrödinger equation is the quantum counterpart of [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_second_law "Newton's second law") in [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"). Given a set of known [initial conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_conditions "Initial conditions"), Newton's second law makes a mathematical prediction as to what path a given [physical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_system "Physical system") will take over time. The Schrödinger equation gives the evolution over time of the [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function "Wave function"), the quantum-mechanical characterization of an [isolated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_system "Isolated system") physical system. The equation was postulated by Schrödinger based on a postulate of [Louis de Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie "Louis de Broglie") that all matter has an associated [matter wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave "Matter wave"). The equation predicted [bound states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_states "Bound states") of the atom in agreement with experimental observations.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation#cite_note-5): II:268

>The Schrödinger equation is not the only way to study quantum mechanical systems and make predictions. Other formulations of quantum mechanics include [matrix mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_mechanics "Matrix mechanics"), introduced by [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg"), and the [path integral formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation "Path integral formulation"), developed chiefly by [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman"). When these approaches are compared, the use of the Schrödinger equation is sometimes called "wave mechanics".

>The equation given by Schrödinger is nonrelativistic because it contains a first derivative in time and a second derivative in space, and therefore space and time are not on equal footing. [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac") incorporated [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") and quantum mechanics into a [single formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation") that simplifies to the Schrödinger equation in the non-relativistic limit. This is the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation"), which contains a single derivative in both space and time. Another [partial differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation"), the [Klein–Gordon equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein%E2%80%93Gordon_equation "Klein–Gordon equation"), led to a problem with probability density even though it was a [relativistic wave equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_wave_equations "Relativistic wave equations"). The probability density could be negative, which is physically unviable. This was fixed by Dirac by taking the so-called square root of the Klein–Gordon operator and in turn introducing [Dirac matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrices "Gamma matrices"). In a modern context, the Klein–Gordon equation describes [spin-less](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_boson "Scalar boson") particles, while the Dirac equation describes [spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion") particles.

I think Wikipedia describes the Schrodinger Equation pretty well.

But now, I would start explaining things myself, from what I understand (of course, from sources LIKE HP3, Wikipedia, etc.)

Schrodinger's Equation is a Differential Equation that says the following:

- There exists a wavefunction associated with each particle, call it $\Psi$
