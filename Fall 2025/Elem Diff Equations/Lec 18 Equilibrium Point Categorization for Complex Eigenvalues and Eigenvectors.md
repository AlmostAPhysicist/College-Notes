$$\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2} > 0 \implies source$$
$$\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2} < 0 \implies sink$$
$$\lambda_{2} < 0 < \lambda_{1} \implies saddle$$

Essentially, $e^{\lambda t}$ would explode **out** if $\lambda>0$ but **die down** if $\lambda<0$ as you increase $t$.

Note: if $\lambda=0$, then your matrix $A$ has determinant equal to $0$.
