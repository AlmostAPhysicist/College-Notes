$\cases{y'(t) = f(t, y(t))\\ y(t_{0})=y_{0} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}}$

$y(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, $f: \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$


So essentially, if you have instead of a single variable, multiple variables (either you treat them as variables representing different things, or simply components of a single vector, doesn't quite matter), you study ODE's defining their behaviors that may or may not be coupled (depend on each other).

So derivatives and integrals are **Linear Operators**.

So there **should** be some **matrix representation of these linear operators**
