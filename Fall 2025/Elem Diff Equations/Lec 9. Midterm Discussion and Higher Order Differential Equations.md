I didn't quite make that many mistakes. But just a few points to note.

- When writing an integral with bounds, MAKE SURE THE BOUNDS HAVE A DIFFERENT VARIABLE than the variable of integration.
	- So make sure you don't have a $\int_{0}^{t} f(t)\, dt$
- Also, when saying $f=y'(t)$ continuously differentiable in $y$, make sure you say $\frac{\partial f(t, y)}{\partial y}$ is continuous, not $\frac{\partial f(t, y(t))}{\partial y}$ since the latter is plugging in a functional solution, causing it to be a single variable function, differentiated in another variable, meaning the latter is zero.
	- You need the ugliness of $f$ for questions like these to show up or not, not kill it with solutions.
- Case wise $y'(t)$ functions
	- $f(x):= \cases{\sqrt{x}, x \geq 0\\ sin(x), x<0}$
