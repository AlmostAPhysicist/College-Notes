## Types of Differential Equations 

### Affine ODEs 
$$\cases{y'(t) = k_{0} + ky(t) \\ y(0) = y_{0}}$$
(right-hand side is a constant + a linear function in $y$)

### Quadratic Equations 
- General Form:
	$\cases{y'(t) = f(t, y(t))\\ y(0)=y_{0}}$ where $f:\mathbb{R}^{2} \to \mathbb{R}$
$f(t, y) = ky^{2}$

Guess: 
$y(t) = \frac{y_{0}}{1-ky_{0}t}$
