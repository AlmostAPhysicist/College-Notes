## Bifurcations 

Solutions to Polynomial equations (roots)
- can be discontinuous in the polynomial coefficients 

<u>Ex</u>
$x^{2} + r = 0$ ($r \in \mathbb{R}$)

- Case 1. $r>0$
	No (Real) Solutions 
- Case 2. $r=0$
	One Solution ($x=0$)
- Case 3. $r<0$
	Two Solutions ($\sqrt{-r}$ and $-\sqrt{-r}$)

So by a slight perturbation near $r=0$, there is a discontinuity in the type of and existence of solutions.

**Saddle node bifurcation**
When eq. points appear/disappear 

$\cases{y'(t) = f(t, y(t) \\ y(t_{0})=y_{0}}$

So, $f(t, y(t))=0$ at such points

<u>Ex.</u>
$f(t,y(t))=y^{2} + r$

$f(t, y(t))=r-y-e^{-y}$, $r \in \mathbb{R}$

**So in this case, is there a special value of $r$ where the nature of the equilibrium point changes?**

### Transcritical Bifurcation 
<u>Ex</u> $f(t, y):=ry-y^{2} = y(r-y)$

Two equilibrium points at $y=0$ and $y=r$.
