So Essentially, For both $I=-0.1$ and $I=0.0$, there are equilibrium points that the neuron can reach (which one, depends on the initial condition, but certainly in both cases, after at most one neural spike, the neuron approaches an equilibrium as $t \to \infty$).

But for $I=0.1$, there are no equilibrium points and so the neuron keeps spiking forever, periodically.
