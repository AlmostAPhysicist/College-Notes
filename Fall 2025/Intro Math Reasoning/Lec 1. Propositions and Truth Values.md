### Equivalence of Propositions
#definition Two *propositions* are equivalent if they have the same <u>truth values</u>. 
(both are true or both are false). We use the symbol $\equiv$ (equivalent) symbol to donate equivalence.

Note: Equivalence is unrelated to causality. For example,

"$5$ is an odd number" is equivalent to "$2+2=4$" even though one is <u>not</u> true BECAUSE of the other.

### New proposition from old 
#### Logical Connectives
- $\sim$ (\sim) or $\neq$ (\neq) — **Negation**
	- results in the opposite truth value
- $\land$ (\land) — **Logical *And* (Conjunction)** 
	- Both must be true to return true
- $\lor$ (\lor) — **Logical *Or* (Disjunction)**
	- At least one has to be true to return true
	- In mathematics, "or" is always inclusive, although definitions may be subject dependent
- $\implies$ or $\to$  (\implies or \to or \rightarrow, usually use \to)— **Conditional Sentence**
	- If $P$ then $Q$ 
	- Implication
	- Formally, $\sim (P \to Q) \equiv P \lor (\sim Q)$
		i.e. an Or between NOT Q would give true whenever Q is false. But if Q is true, Not Q is false, and therefore the right-hand side would be true only if P is true, given that Q is also true.
		- Note that this can only be false if $P$ is true and $Q$ is false, that is the hypothesis is true, yet you don't get the promise.
			- If the hypothesis is false, the promise is arbitrary and the proposition is automatically true 
			- So if P is false, you don't even need to look at Q.
			- And of course, if both the hypothesis and promise are made true, then the truth value of the proposition is true.
