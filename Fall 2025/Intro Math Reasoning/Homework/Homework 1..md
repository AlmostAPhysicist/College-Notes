- a) $P$ is false and $P \implies Q$ is true:
Since the conditional proposition is true when the hypothesis is false, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion, **$Q$ may have either truth value**.

- b) $P$ is true and $P \implies Q$ is true:
Since $P \implies Q$ can only be true for $P$ being true if $Q$ is ALSO true, **$Q$ is true**.

- c) $P$ is true and $P \implies Q$ is false:
Since the hypothesis is true, the conditional can only be false if the conclusion is false. **Q is false**.

- d) $P$ is false and $P \iff Q$ is true:
For this conditional statement to be true, either both $P$ and $Q$ are true or both are false, therefore, **$Q$ is false**.

- e) $P$ is true and $P \iff Q$ is false:
For this conditional statement to be false, one of $P$ or $Q$ must be false. Therefore **$Q$ is false**.

### 5.
a) The conditional has the structure $P \implies Q$, and both $P$ and $Q$ are both true, thus the conditional statement is **true**.

b) The conditional has the structure $P \implies Q$ where $P$ is true, but $Q$ is false (regardless of how true one would want the moon to be made of cheese). Therefore, it is **false**.

c) This too has the same structure, but here $P$ is false, hence the conditional is true (the truth value of $Q$ is irrelevant, although it is true.)

d) Again, the same structure. Even though $Q$ is false, again, like c), $P$ is false, so the conditional is true regardless.

e) The claim of the statement “one interior angle of a right triangle is $92 \degree$“ would always be false (since the interior angle of a right triangle can only be 90, if talking about the right angle itself, or less than that.) therefore, $P$ is false and hence $P \implies Q$ is true.

f) Since Euclid's true birthday is not known, $P$'s truth value can not be known. However, $Q$ is true. So it doesn't matter what the truth value of $P$ is, $P \implies Q$ is true.

g) $P \impliedby Q$, here $Q$ is false (since $\sqrt{2}$ IS an irrational number), hence the conditional is true.

h) Since $P$ is true but $Q$ is false, $P$ is not sufficient for $Q$ (i.e. $Q$ is clearly not true whenever $P$ is true.)

True conditionals:
a), b), c), d), f), h), j)


### 13.
a) if $1+1=2$ then $2+2=4$
b) if I am the tallest person in the world (I am not) then all squares have 4 sides.
c) $P \implies Q$'s contrapositive would be $\sim Q \implies \sim P$ 
For the contrapositive to be false, $\sim P$ must be false and $\sim Q$ must be true, meaning $Q$ must be false and $P$ must be true.
But for that, $P \implies Q$ would be false. Therefore, it is not possible.
d) if $0>1$ then $10>20$

### 14.
a) if $1+2=2+1$ then $2 = 1$
b) Not possible. Since the only way the conditional $P \implies Q$ is false is if $P$ is true and $Q$ is false, and its converse will always be true.
c) if $2$ is even, then $0$ is odd.
d) Not possible, again, since for $P \implies Q$, $P$ must be true and $Q$ must be false for the conditional to be false. But that means the contrapositive ($\sim Q \implies \sim P$) is always false.
