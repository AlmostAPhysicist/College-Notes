**Functions:** They map the domain to a co domain and every input has to have a unique output.

**Functionals:** (in the context of calculus of variations) as ALSO a function! It <u>maps functions</u> (its domain is a function space of usually smooth functions, or in configuration space: generalized coordinates of space with respect to time) to a real (or maybe complex, but in this context, since we minimize something, it only makes sense to talk about the Reals) <u>number</u>


Functionals of Euler-Lagrange type are of form: $$I(x) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x(t), \dot{x}(t), t)\, dt$$

Note: $\dot{x} :=\frac{dx}{dt}$

We need to take a directional derivative of $I$ with a perturbation $sy$ where $s$ is some scalar that scales the function $y$ in your input function.
$\phi(s):= I(x+sy)$

We want $\phi'(0)$ (the directional derivative of the functional $I$ with respect to perturbation $y$.)

$y$ has to vanish strongly.

At point (function) $x=x*$, all directional derivatives with respect to any perturbation to vanish, including $\phi'(0)$.

> If you are finding critical points of a Function then you see when the function's output stops varying for changes in your output, as you vary the output by some small amounts.

Again, Functionals are just functions.

>So you again find its critical points by varying the input FUNCTION by a small perturbation FUNCTION and see for what input function does the perturbation have its effects going to zero for your functional.
