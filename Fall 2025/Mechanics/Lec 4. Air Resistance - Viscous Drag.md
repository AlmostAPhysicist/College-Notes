We know that usually, in the idealized vacuum, the projectile of an object follows a parabolic arc. But now we would consider more niche cases, in addition to just gravity, which seems to be independent of the motion of the object.

## Linear Air Resistance 
(Viscous Drag)

$m\vec{a} = m \ddot{\vec{r}} = m\vec{g} - b\vec{v}$

$\implies m \dot{\vec{v}} = m\vec{g} - b\vec{v}$ (Essentially, we could have had the function $\vec{r}(t)$ be our base function, being the unknown function that we find, but since we can just deal with $\vec{v}(t)$, it's just a first order differential equation, making our lives easier)

Often, the differential equations are not solvable. In those cases, we approximate the equations with Taylor Series Expansions.
