## Oscillation
Hook's Law:
$F_{x}(x) = -kx$
$U(x) = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$

The reason Hook's law is an important point of discussion is, that it's a first order approximation of all Oscillation Forces

## Simple Harmonic Motion 
$F = ma$
$-kx = m \ddot{x}$
$\ddot{x} = \frac{-k}{m}x$

For $\omega^{2} = \frac{k}{m}$
$\boxed{\ddot{x}=-\omega^{x}x}$

The solution to this differential equation, in its most general form is
$x(t) = c_{1}e^{i \omega t} + c_{2}e^{-i \omega t}$

$c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ can be complex constants

$e^{i \omega t} = cos(\omega t) + i sin(\omega t)$
$x(t) = (c_{1} + c_{2})cos(\omega t) + i(c_{1}-c_{2})sin(\omega t)$
$= B_{1}cos(\omega t) + B_{2}sin(\omega t)$

$B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ are real constants
