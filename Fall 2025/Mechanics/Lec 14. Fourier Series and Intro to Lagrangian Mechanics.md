## Fourier Series 
- Periodic function
$f(t)=f(t+\tau)$
$\tau=\text{time period}$
$f(t) = \sum_{0}^{\infty}[a_{n}cos(n \omega t) + b_{n}sin(n \omega t)]$
$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{\tau}$

$\displaystyle a_{n} = \frac{2}{\tau} \int_{\frac{-\tau}{2}}^{\frac{\tau}{2}}f(t)cos(n \omega t)\, dt$
$b_{n} = \dots sin(n \omega t) \dots$

# Lagrangian mechanics
>Switching the direction of the course completely.

We would first have to get some mathematical tools under our tool belt...
## Calculus of Variations 
We would see what this is for a very specific mathematical problem.

Next time, we would PROVE the Euler Lagrange Equation (using Integration by parts).
